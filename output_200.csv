Kherson: Ukraine claims new push in Russian-held region,"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 21:14:11 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-62712299,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-62712299?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Ukraine is seeking to retake the southern Kherson region - but Russia says the offensive failed.,"Ukraine's military says it has broken through Russia's first line of defence in the occupied Kherson region. The reported push appears to form part of a long-awaited counter-offensive being launched by Kyiv in an attempt to retake the country's south.  It follows weeks of Ukrainian attacks aimed at cutting off Russian forces there from main supply routes. Russia's military claims that Ukrainian troops suffered ""heavy losses"" during an unsuccessful attacking attempt.  The claims by both Ukraine and Russia have not been independently verified. Kherson became the first major Ukrainian city to fall into Russian hands after troops advanced into the city from the Crimean Peninsula in the opening days of the war.  Early on Monday, Ukraine's Kakhovka operational group in the south said that one regiment of Russian-backed forces had left its positions in the Kherson region. It added that Russian paratroopers providing the back-up had fled the battlefield. Oleksiy Arestovych, adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky's head of office, later also said that Ukraine's armed forces ""have broken through the frontline in several places"". In his late night video address, President Zelensky issued a stark warning to Russian forces: ""If they want to survive, it is time for Russian soldiers to flee. Go home."" Explosions and shots were heard for a second day on Tuesday in the regional capital of Kherson. Blasts had earlier been reported in Nova Kakhovka, some 55km (34 miles) north-east and Russia's state-run Ria Novosti news agency reported the city was left without electricity and water supply overnight. In an update early on Tuesday, a spokesman for Ukraine's southern operational command said 13 Russian command posts had been destroyed, as well as three ammunition depots and a crossing over the Dnipro river.  Kyiv officials say they have used US-supplied Himars rocket systems to destroy key crossings on the Dnipro in recent weeks and are now targeting makeshift Russian pontoon bridges. According to Western military sources, Kyiv's strikes are part of a targeted effort to cut off Russian troops on the right (western) bank of the river with the ultimate goal of recapturing the entire Kherson region. A UK defence intelligence assessment said Russia had made significant efforts to reinforce the western bank but most of its units were ""likely undermanned and are reliant upon fragile supply lines"". President Zelensky and other top Ukrainian officials have been tight-lipped about details of the reported counter-offensive, urging Ukrainians to be patient. Responding to the Ukrainian claims, Russia's defence ministry said that Ukrainian troops had attempted an offensive in the Kherson and neighbouring Mykolaiv regions. The ministry was quoted by Russia's state-run news agencies as saying this operation had failed, and that the Ukrainian troops had ""suffered heavy losses"".  Retaking Kherson from the Russians will be a major challenge for Ukraine. This southern city was captured early in the war with little resistance so Russian forces have had months to dig in, bring in reinforcements and prepare for any counter-attack.  Since the invasion began in February, Ukraine has been fighting almost entirely defensive battles, putting up a stoic resistance to overwhelming Russian numbers. It has had little experience of offensive operations which generally require a different skill set, an advantage in numbers and large reserves of ammunition and troops.  The Russians have been able to take the territory they have in Donbas and places like Mariupol because they have no hesitation in reducing a town to rubble with massed artillery and little consideration for civilian casualties. Ukraine though, does have these constraints and it will not want to see this vital port city flattened to ashes.  But in Ukraine's favour are ever-increasing numbers of long-range Western-supplied arms which can cut off Russian supply lines, plus the fact that this is their land and their determination to recover it gives them a greater incentive than most of the Russian invaders. Kherson, which had a population of 290,000 before the war, is the only regional capital to have been taken by Russian forces and is currently administered by Moscow-backed officials. According to Russia's Tass news agency, officials in the Kherson region have started moving forward with plans to hold a referendum on formally joining Russia, prompting accusations by the US that Russia could be preparing to illegally annex parts of occupied southern Ukraine. Last month, Russia said its military focus was no longer only on eastern Ukraine but on its southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia too. Speaking to Russia's RIA news agency, the head of the Russian installed administration, Kirill Stremousov, insisted the city was not under threat of attack and said the ""more the area is shelled, the more its inhabitants demand a referendum"".  Elsewhere, at least five people were killed when Russian shells hit the centre of Kharkiv in north-east Ukraine on Tuesday, according to the city's mayor. Two people were killed by Russian artillery fire on the southern city of Mykolaiv, city officials said on Monday.  Meanwhile, an inspection team from the UN nuclear watchdog has arrived in Ukraine ahead of a planned visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. Ukrainian officials say the team will travel to the plant in the coming days. Russian-installed officials in the Zaporizhzhia region have again accused Ukrainian forces of shelling the area around the plant. They said on Monday that a hole had been punched in the roof of a fuel depot by a missile strike. The claim has not been independently verified.  In recent weeks, both Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling Europe's biggest nuclear station, which was seized by Russia in early March. Moscow has kept Ukrainian personnel to operate the station. Last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the world narrowly avoided a radiation accident at the plant, blaming Moscow's actions for this.

Monkeypox infections rise as guidance advises cases to abstain from sex,"Mon, 30 May 2022 18:41:31 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-61640196,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-61640196?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Anyone who tests positive should abstain from sex while symptomatic and use condoms for eight weeks.,"Another 71 cases of monkeypox have been identified in England over the weekend bringing the UK total to 179, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says. New guidance is advising anyone with the virus to abstain from sex while they have symptoms. They are also told to use condoms for eight weeks after an infection as a precaution. The risk to the population is low, but people should be alert to new rashes or lesions, the UKHSA says. In total, 172 cases have been confirmed in England, with four in Scotland, two in Northern Ireland and one in Wales. New guidance for doctors and other healthcare workers to help control the latest outbreak has now been agreed by the four health authorities in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.  People who have tested positive for the virus and their close contacts are being told to isolate at home for 21 days.  They should avoid contact with other people until all lesions - or blisters - have healed and scabs have dried off.  Anyone with a confirmed infection is now being advised to abstain from sex while they have symptoms. The guidance says that while there is currently no available evidence that monkeypox can be spread in sexual fluids, people confirmed to have the virus are advised to use condoms for eight weeks after infection as a precaution.  Confirmed cases and their close contacts should take extra care if they need to leave the house to see a doctor or other health worker.  This means making sure any lesions are covered by clothes, wearing a face covering and avoiding public transport where possible. What is Monkeypox? James Gallagher explains what it is and if we should be worried. Available now on BBC iPlayer Dr Ruth Milton, monkeypox strategic response director, at UKHSA said: ""The highest risk of transmission is through direct contact with someone with monkeypox.  ""The risk to the UK population remains low and anyone with unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body should immediately contact NHS 111 or their local sexual health service."" The new guidance also says healthcare workers who are pregnant and people with severely weakened immune systems should not care for anyone who is suspected or confirmed to have monkeypox. Staff working with confirmed cases should wear personal protective equipment, including FFP3 respirators, aprons, eye protection and gloves as a minimum, it adds. Those working with possible cases are recommended to wear surgical face masks which are fluid repellent, gowns, gloves and eye protection. UK health officials have purchased over 20,000 doses of a smallpox vaccine called Imvanex. It is being offered to close contacts of those diagnosed with the virus to try to reduce the risk of symptomatic infection and severe illness.

Sturgeon reported to police for not wearing mask ,"Sun, 17 Apr 2022 17:16:44 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-61135232,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-61135232?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Footage shows Nicola Sturgeon without a mask during a visit to a barber shop in East Kilbride.,"Nicola Sturgeon has been reported to police after being filmed apparently breaching Scotland's face mask rules. Footage on social media shows the first minister without a mask in an East Kilbride barber shop, which she had visited on the election campaign trail. She posted footage of the visit on her own Instagram account with her mask on. The SNP said Ms Sturgeon realised she was not wearing a mask ""within a few seconds"" of entering the shop. Until Monday, it was legally required for people to wear face coverings in many indoor settings in Scotland. The law has now become guidance. A Police Scotland spokesperson said: ""We can confirm that we have received a complaint which is currently being assessed."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

During the visit to the barber shop on Saturday, Ms Sturgeon shaved a man's beard while journalists took photographs. The SNP leader later posted footage on her own social media feeds, describing it as ""surreal"" but one of the best and ""scariest"" things she had done on the campaign trail. However, further footage was later posted online showing her interacting with people without her mask on. A SNP spokesperson said: ""The first minister was invited into the barbers during an outdoor visit on the street.  ""Within a few seconds, she realised she hadn't put her mask back on and immediately put it on."" In December 2020 Ms Sturgeon apologised for breaching Covid-19 restrictions when she briefly removed her mask at a funeral. The Scottish Conservatives have condemned the latest apparent breach of the rules as ""blatant hypocrisy"". The party's health spokesman Dr Sandesh Gulhane MSP said: ""The video clearly shows Nicola Sturgeon isn't practising what she preaches on facemasks. ""She's happy virtue signalling for official photos but behind closed doors it's clear she doesn't believe in her own rules so why should anyone else. ""The public, who have been under these legal Covid restrictions for over two years, deserve an apology for this rule break."" A Scot Liberal Democrat spokesperson added: ""It's incumbent on all politicians to set a good example. It looks like Nicola Sturgeon has lost track of what her own rules are.""  The BBC has contacted Scottish Labour and the Scottish Greens for comment.

Joe Clarke expresses 'embarrassment and shame' over WhatsApp messages,"Tue, 24 May 2022 15:49:06 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/61569278,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/61569278?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Nottinghamshire batter Joe Clarke says he feels ""embarrassment and shame"" over his involvement in a WhatsApp group with rapist Alex Hepburn."," Last updated on 24 May 202224 May 2022.From the section Cricket Nottinghamshire batter Joe Clarke says he feels ""embarrassment and shame"" over his involvement in a vulgar WhatsApp group with rapist Alex Hepburn. Clarke was not charged but was named during the rape trial of his former Worcestershire team-mate in 2019. The sexist messages led to Clarke, 25, being made unavailable for selection by England and charged with bringing the game into disrepute. ""It does not reflect the person I am now,"" Clarke told the Telegraphexternal-link. ""I have done a lot of reflecting. It is embarrassment and shame that I was involved in what was a terrible thing. ""I'm happy I have the chance now and say how sorry I am for the involvement in all of it."" Clarke was speaking in his first major interview since being named during the Hepburn trial. Last month, England's new director of men's cricket Rob Key suggested he would be open to Clarke being picked. Hepburn was jailed for five years after being found guilty of assaulting a sleeping woman after she had consensual sex with Clarke. Hepburn, Clarke and then Worcestershire team-mate Tom Kohler-Cadmore swapped messages on WhatsApp discussing a game of sexual conquests. The judge said the WhatsApp messages ""demeaned women"" and ""trivialised rape"". ""It upsets me seeing it [the WhatsApp game] now so I completely understand why people get upset looking at it,"" Clarke said. ""It is terrible to look at. It was completely wrong."" He also said he had ""let down"" the victim, who suffered post-traumatic stress disorder.  ""She was ultimately in my company and relied on me for her safety and I did not provide that,"" Clarke said. ""I feel like I let her down and I hope that she has found happiness that she deserves now and has managed to move on.""

The Hundred: Are the boundaries in the women's competition too small?,"Wed, 24 Aug 2022 18:21:07 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/62637340,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/62637340?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,We are seeing more sixes and higher scores in this year's women's Hundred - but is that because the boundaries are too small?," Last updated on 24 August 202224 August 2022.From the section The Hundred Big hitting has been one of one of the most thrilling aspects of this year's women's Hundred. Some of the most exciting players in the world - Deandra Dottin at Headingley or Alice Capsey at The Oval - demonstrating their masterful technique by smashing balls over the boundary rope and into the stands. But as the sixes and the fours stack up a debate has also been brewing.   Boundaries for women's matches are smaller compared to men's games because of the obvious difference in physicality - but are they too small?  ""It is a fine line,"" former England international Lydia Greenway told BBC Sport. ""If you are in a situation where you are only getting singles, fours and sixes because the boundaries are so short then I don't think the game is as watchable."" According to Opta, the average 100-ball total in the 2021 edition of the women's event was 119, while so far this year it is 137. Last season, 2.8 boundary sixes were struck on average in each completed game, this year that rate is 5.2. Similarly, 26.7 boundary fours were struck each game last season whilst that rate is 32.7 this season.  More runs and more boundaries. That's a good thing, right? Not necessarily. Smaller boundaries may make it easier to hit fours and sixes but it also makes it harder to find gaps in the field and run two, removing a key element of the batter's armoury. ""A massive feature of the women's game is the skill level and technique, it has to be immaculate because they do not have the power,"" said Greenway. ""So you want them to have the opportunity to push the twos and threes if they can."" The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), which organises the Hundred, does not dictate exact boundary sizes to each team. Instead they have minimum and maximum sizes, which are aligned with international women's cricket. The exact size is then determined by the team's head coach. The regulations say that no boundary should exceed a distance of 70 yards from the centre of the pitch. According to the ECB, more boundaries were played at 60 yards earlier in the competition, but that has increased to 65 yards over the last week. This is broadly similar to the 2021 edition. So if the field sizes are not significantly smaller - what is behind the the increase in boundaries? ""Another reason why we are seeing a lot more sixes is time on task for the players,"" said Greenway. ""A lot of us played in an era where we couldn't do the strength training that we needed to do, or the multiple times you have to practice hitting the ball a long way. We just didn't have the time."" There are also other factors at play. Firstly, the hot, dry weather England has experienced this summer has resulted in much quicker outfields, meaning the ball will race along the ground and over the boundary rope for four faster than on a greener, lusher surface. There is also a relatively small pool of players who are regularly hitting sixes. There have been 19 batters to have hit more than one six so far in this year's women's competition, an average of 2.3 players per team. In comparison there have been 50 players so far in the men's tournament. ""The boundaries are fine,"" said Welsh Fire bowler Alex Hartley. ""There have been a couple of times when they've been smaller but I think they've been standard size for women's games - it's just because you're playing on bigger grounds they look smaller. ""I was comparing the men's and women's games the other day and I don't like to do that but I was racking my mind about why there are so many twos in the men's game compared to the women's. It's because they are so quick between the wickets. That is the difference, they are honestly rapid."" The ECB said it will review the minimum and maximum boundary lengths next year in line with the ""accelerated professionalisation of the women's game"". The result could be bigger boundaries and fewer sixes in 2023, but also perhaps a spectacle more aligned to the talents of the all-round modern player. ""There's no doubt that men's and women's cricket is different when it comes to power, that will never change,"" said Greenway. ""But the women's game has only reached a certain percentage of their capabilities. ""Hopefully that will keep increasing.""

BBC launches first Green Sport Awards to celebrate sustainability,"Thu, 23 Jun 2022 16:00:05 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/61912411,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/61912411?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The BBC is launching its first Green Sport Awards - to celebrate individuals and organisations contributing to a more sustainable future.," Last updated on 23 June 202223 June 2022.From the section Sport The BBC has launched its first Green Sport Awards - to celebrate those people in sport helping to contribute to a more sustainable future. BBC winter sports commentator and presenter Ed Leigh has been outspoken on the threat snowsport faces - saying it is ""at the sharp end"" of climate change with the impact on shortened winter seasons. Leigh believes the Green Sport Awards will help ""incentivise"" those already ""working at the vanguard of climate change in sport"", as well as encourage other athletes, clubs and organisations to join in. ""If you have something like the BBC Green Sport Awards, the logic behind them is that you raise awareness,"" he said.  ""It's the old adage - and this is used in sport a lot - 'if you can't see it, you can't be it'. ""If you drill down into climate change day after day it can be utterly overwhelming. It is imperative that we celebrate the successes, because you can't have endless doom and gloom. ""You need to see the positives and see what we're achieving and that's exactly what the Green Sport Awards have been created for."" Leigh says the connection between sport and climate change is ""simple"", in that sustainability ""affects every aspect of our lives"". ""The way that you choose to go to a football match, the way that you travel to go to netball, table tennis, Jiu-Jitsu... every decision you make in your life is affecting climate change and therefore sport is not immune to that. ""Sport is a part of the climate discussion and therefore we need to be involved and we need to be proactive."" The Green Sport Awards are part of the BBC's commitment to a greener future and are designed to use the power and passion of sport for a positive effect. Partnering with Sport Positive Summit, the awards will celebrate individuals and organisations from across the globe who are actively contributing to a more sustainable future through their sporting profile and practises. The BBC Green Sport Awards 2022 have five categories - which you can read more about here. They are: Nominations for two of the awards are open now and close at 12:00 BST on 31 July 2022. All winners will be announced on the BBC Sport Website on 4 October and featured in a special BBC Green Sport Awards 2022 programme.

Ukraine: Spam website set up to reach millions of Russians,"Sat, 12 Mar 2022 00:35:07 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-60697261,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-60697261?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,A Norwegian computer expert has made a system for volunteers to email millions of Russian people about the war,"A Norwegian computer expert has created a website enabling anyone to send an email about the war in Ukraine to up to 150 Russian email addresses at a time, so that Russian people have a chance to hear the truth their government is hiding. All over Russia email inboxes are pinging. Millions of messages are being received with the same intriguing subject Ya vam ne vrag - I am not your enemy. The message appears in Russian with an English translation and it begins: ""Dear friend, I am writing to you to express my concern for the secure future of our children on this planet. Most of the world has condemned Putin's invasion of Ukraine."" The lengthy email goes on to implore Russian people to reject the war in Ukraine and seek the truth about the invasion from non-state news services. In just a few days, more than 22 million of these emails landed in Russian inboxes, and they're being sent by volunteers around the world, who are donating their time and email addresses to the cause. It's one of a growing number of unusual ways that hackers, activists and every day people around the world are trying to reach out to Russian people online to circumvent media blocks and censorship. One Polish Twitter user's idea to post reviews talking about the war to Russian businesses on Google and Yandex went viral. Elsewhere hacker groups claim to have defaced Russian news websites with messages to Russian people to ""stop Putin"". But the spam email campaign created by a small team in Norway seems to have caught the imagination of thousands of people searching for ways to help Russians learn about the war.   ""During the Second World War, and in earlier wars, people flew over Germany with leaflets and dropped them out. This is just a more modern way of trying to get people to open their eyes,"" says Fabian, who came up with the idea. The 50-year-old Norwegian, who runs a computer network business, doesn't want his surname to be published for fear of retaliation from the Russian authorities. He says he felt compelled to do something after becoming increasingly anxious about the possibility of World War Three. His website, which the BBC is not naming, is circumventing Russian censorship through a mix of clever computing and people power. The system allows people to send his templated message to dozens of Russian email addresses at once, and he estimates that tens of thousands of volunteers have done this since the website went live. Fabian built it with five colleagues, who worked flat-out last weekend to get the job done. They started by trawling the internet for known Russian email addresses and compiled a list of 90 million accounts they believe are active. He says the strength of the system lies in getting volunteers to use their own email accounts instead of bulk-messaging the email addresses using spam software. Users can choose to contact from one to 150 Russian people. Then, with a click, the volunteer's default email client (Outlook or Gmail, for example) is loaded up with the unique email addresses, subject and body text ready to send. People are also able to personalise the contents too, to increase the chances of getting their email read.  There are two reasons, says Fabian, for using people's personal email accounts: the emails get through email spam filters if they are sent from real accounts, and in small numbers.  ""But also, people can actually receive replies from Russians and engage with them and have conversations about the war."" Fabian says some accounts will be less active than others and in some cases the email may end up in the junk mail folder. But many of the messages are being read, he says, and some Russians are replying.  Alex, also in Norway, was asked to test the system by Fabian's team, but has kept sending emails since. ""I've sent around 500 emails so far and got around 20 replies within a day, so I'm hoping for more,"" he says. ""Most of the replies are people asking me to take them off my mailing list but I got talking to a 35-year-old woman from St Petersburg. She told me she wasn't sure what was going on in the conflict and wanted to know more. She said there was a lack of news coming out of Europe and she wanted to read about it all but didn't know how to get through the blocks on websites."" Alex then explained how she could sidestep Russia's internet blocks ""I think I've got a friend in her now!"" he says. Another 18-year-old volunteer shared the reply she received from an unknown Russian. The message argued strongly that she was wrong and it was Ukraine that was killing innocent people which is why ""this special operation is a necessary measure"".    Fabian says his team are constantly tweaking the text and subject of their email template to evade email spam filters, and hope many of the 90 million email addresses will eventually receive the message. If they run out of emails to try he says the team will find more. They have also had to fend off attacks from unknown hackers trying to bring the site down. Fabian argues that what he is doing is ""not propaganda"". Asked how he feels about spamming millions of people, he replies that the intrusion is justified because the stakes are so high. Is he putting unsuspecting recipients in danger? ""You can't charge the recipient of the email. They're served our email without being able to consent to it, so it's kind of involuntarily receiving a leaflet. It's literally a war. You have to stand up for what you believe in. And I believe in this."" Rosenberg: Russia's stage-managed election 'Every day felt like an eternity' - freed Israeli hostage.

Bedfordshire Police said further bodies could be found in the coming days after 20 flats were engulfed in flames in Redwood Grove. Eyewitnesses described hearing an explosion at about 09:30 BST. The fire service said an investigation was under way and more details would become known in the coming days. Ch Supt John Murphy said: ""Very sadly we know that at least one person has passed away in the explosion today. ""There is a possibility that there will be more fatalities discovered in the coming days as we continue to search through the scene and a number of people, as my colleague from the fire services has identified, were injured as well today."" Adrian Mazurkiwicz, who lives in a top floor flat in a three-storey block adjoining the one where the explosion happened, said he saw two people jump from windows to escape the blaze. He told how on hearing the explosion, he and his partner rushed to ""start knocking on people's doors to get everybody out, and then when I was outside the building I saw the walls being torn apart... and all of the windows out, and smoke and flames pretty much instantly"". ""I saw a couple of people jump out of the building and started helping them out... bringing them away from the fire, away from the danger, but it was a very, very serious and very big explosion,"" he said. Mr Mazurkiwicz's flat has been destroyed in the blaze. He said he hoped his neighbours in the building were all ""OK"". ""We saw people jumping out from the flat that was directly affected,"" he said. ""I think that was the flat that blew up, and that was where the gentleman jumped out and hurt his hip really badly - we pulled him away. ""And then I saw another gentleman on the other side of the building - seems like he's just been blown out of the window by the whole explosion."" He added: ""The walls [of the building] have just been completely cracked like a walnut - there's been so much debris flying out of everywhere - ashes, smoke, dust, fire - just instantly everywhere - blazing out of the windows - and that's why people started to jump out."" This video can not be played Witness Alex Feltham said he heard ""a large boom"" at about 09:30 BST ""and the roof of the block of flats had been destroyed"" An emergency centre has been set up at The John Bunyan Centre in Bedford for evacuees and those needing support, police said. Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service said the fire was caused by a ""major gas explosion"" and urged people to keep doors and windows closed. Witness Alex Feltham said after hearing the ""boom"" the block of flats became ""a raging inferno"". Another witness, Adam Fisher, described ""a huge explosion"". ""Everyone went to our work car park to see what was happening,"" he said. ""Our building is adjacent to the apartment complex - immediately an inferno [was] visible, huge smoke cloud billowing, people screaming and people frantically calling for emergency services."" A block of flats next to the three-storey block where the explosion happened has also been evacuated, and police said they were ""working as quickly as we can to get people back into their homes as quickly as possible"". Dezso Balazs lives in a neighbouring block of flats. ""I heard a big noise like an explosion and then I grabbed my family and we came out and we saw the next flat block on fire. Part of the building had been blasted out. Everybody started to panic and run around. ""Everybody just looked after their loved ones and other people to make sure everybody was all right."" A nearby primary school was also been evacuated. Andy George, head of Shackleton Primary School, said: ""Following the fire in the Redwood Grove area of Bedford earlier today, pupils at Shackleton Primary have been sent home due to the school's proximity to the incident. ""All children are safe and the school is working with the emergency services. The school expects to re-open tomorrow."" Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Chris Mason: Who will be our next PM?,"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 23:30:32 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-63339578,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-63339578?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Liz Truss leaves her successor a party in chaos, spiralling prices, rising interest rates and squeezed budgets.","Who, on earth, will be our next prime minister, in under 10 days time? Another new prime minister.  In the blink of an eye.  With the tiniest slice of the country getting a say. This is entirely constitutionally proper, by the way, in a parliamentary democracy. The party leader who can command a majority in the House of Commons becomes prime minister. And, as Liz Truss discovered rather quicker than she might have hoped, when you can't command that majority, you're done for.  But what is constitutionally proper can still be politically tricky. Whoever wins will face a clamour from opposition parties for a general election, although those calls may carry a little less force if one particular chap ends up winning.  And yes, right now in Westminster, a familiar question crops up the whole time.   'What â and how â will Boris Johnson do?'  Could a man ejected from office by his party a matter of weeks ago make the most astonishing of comebacks? The lesson of the last few weeks is don't rule out the astonishing. Would Conservative MPs, party members and the country at large forgive him so soon? He will argue he can rescue the Tories from their calamitous unpopularity under Liz Truss and that he has a mandate from the electorate, having led his party to victory at the last election. Then there is Rishi Sunak.  September's runner-up doesn't usually get to become October's prime minister, but remember, the usual has gone out of fashion.  The defeated candidate last time, who's been vindicated on the economy â he spent the summer saying Liz Truss's plans would be a disaster.  Don't expect an immediate declaration from him, but it'd be surprising if he were not a candidate. Then there is Penny Mordaunt.  The surprise candidate for many over the summer, she finished third last time.  We may hear something about her intentions as soon as today.  There are then people like Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and the former home secretary Suella Braverman. And so the arm-twisting, phone-bashing and spreadsheet-populating begins.  Visions and pledges made privately and then publicly.  New Conservative visions in an accelerated popularity contest.  Liz Truss is a history maker. For all the wrong reasons. The speediest, most efficient humiliation in British political history, meaning once again we have a zombie government and a caretaker prime minister.  Liz Truss bequeaths her successor a party in chaos, spiralling prices, rising interest rates and squeezed government budgets. A horrible inheritance, yes, but a prized opportunity nonetheless.

Is the market turmoil Liz Truss's fault?,"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 18:46:32 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/63229204,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/63229204?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The chancellor has been sacked after turmoil on the financial markets.,"New Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has reversed almost all of the tax measures outlined by his predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng three weeks ago.  The mini-budget of 23 September - included Â£45bn of unfunded tax cuts - and was followed by days of turmoil on the markets, a fall in the value of the pound and rises in the cost of UK government borrowing and mortgage rates.  Prime Minister Liz Truss subsequently sacked Mr Kwarteng and acknowledged that ""it is clear that parts of our mini-budget went further and faster than markets were expecting"".  Previously, Ms Truss, Mr Kwarteng, Business Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg and other ministers had defended the mini-budget, focusing on the effect of global factors like rising inflation and interest rates rather than acknowledging that the 23 September announcement had a profound impact. So, what has been going on?  It is true that interest rates have been rising around the world as central banks, including the Bank of England (BoE), try to control inflation, made worse by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the energy price shock which followed. On 22 September, the BoE announced it was increasing the UK's base rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 2.25%. This is the interest rate on which commercial banks base the amount you pay for borrowing money, and what banks pay you for saving money with them.  The day before, the US central bank had raised its interest rates by more - 0.75 percentage points to between 3% and 3.25%. Following the BoE's decision, the UK government's long-term borrowing costs - the interest rate the government has to pay to borrow money on the international markets - rose immediately. By the BoE's own analysis, long-term gilt yields were 0.2 percentage points higher at the end of the day as compared with the start. The next day - 23 September - Mr Kwarteng delivered his mini-budget starting at 09:35 BST. This included the government's support scheme for energy bills - which had already been announced. This was due to last two years for households and the Treasury estimated it would cost Â£60bn for the first six months. It also included a cut in National Insurance and the reversal of a planned rise in corporation tax. These tax changes were pledged by Ms Truss during her Conservative leadership campaign and were widely expected to happen. But Mr Kwarteng went further, announcing he would cut the basic rate of income tax a year earlier than expected and get rid of the top rate altogether.  The package of tax cuts announced in the mini-budget totalled Â£45bn and were unfunded in that the government did not set out what savings it might make.  The mini-budget was not accompanied by an assessment of its plans by the government's official spending watchdog - the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - as happens at every budget.  Following the chancellor's statement, the UK government's cost of long-term borrowing rose sharply. According to the BoE, long-term gilt yields rose 0.3 percentage points over the course of the day.  The markets were closed over the weekend, but in a BBC interview on Sunday 25 September, Mr Kwarteng indicated there were more tax cuts to come.  On Monday 26 September, the pound fell to record lows against the dollar in early trading in Asia. There was also a sharp rise in the cost of long-term government borrowing. Long-term gilt yields had gone up 0.5 percentage points by the end of the day, according to the BoE. Comparing the cost of government borrowing - on this measure - across the G7 group of advanced economies, it is clear that there was a sharp spike in UK long-term borrowing costs following the mini-budget - which wasn't seen in the other countries.  If you just look at the changes to the cost of government borrowing since 1 September (Liz Truss officially became prime minister on 6 September) the trend is even clearer. The cost of borrowing for the UK government has risen considerably more in that period than it has in other G7 countries. This increase fed through into rising mortgage rates with hundreds of products withdrawn from the mortgage market.  It also had an impact on UK pension funds - which trade in government debt (30-year gilts). The BoE described the speed and scale of movements in interest rates on UK government bonds as ""unprecedented"". It had to step in to safeguard the pensions sector with a support scheme - worth a potential Â£65bn. The change to corporation tax was a key pledge Liz Truss made during her Conservative leadership campaign. On 11 August, she said she wanted to scrap the planned rise because, ""I don't think that's a good way to get our economy going and to attract investment into our country.""  The National Insurance cut was another of her campaign promises that made it into the mini-budget. On the scrapping of the top rate of income tax, Ms Truss was asked who had come up with this - she said it was the chancellor's decision. Mr Kwarteng was asked whether he had got her backing for it before the announcement and replied, ""of course"". On the absence of the OBR from the mini-budget, Ms Truss said the government didn't have time to wait for its forecast. The OBR wrote in a letter that it would have been in a position to produce an updated forecast for the 23 September announcement.  On the morning of 14 October, a Number 10 source told the BBC that the prime minister and chancellor were ""in lockstep"" - hours before she sacked him.  Speaking on 29 September, BoE Chief Economist Huw Pill said the turmoil on the markets in part ""reflects broader global developments... but there is undoubtedly a UK-specific component"". On 12 October, Sanjay Raya, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, told a committee of MPs that Russia's invasion of Ukraine as well as high inflation were causing global instability and volatility in the markets.  But he added that there was ""absolutely a UK component here"". Mr Raya said: ""You throw on the 23 September event, you've got a sidelined fiscal watchdog, lack of a medium-term fiscal plan, one of the largest unfunded tax cuts that we've seen... since the early 1970s and it's sort of the straw that broke the camel's back."" Institute for Government chief economist Gemma Tetlow told the same committee that part of the problem had stemmed from the government undermining key economic institutions, ""questioning their credibility and not asking for a forecast from the OBR"". She added that while the temporary emergency measures to limit energy prices probably could have been announced without an OBR forecast, ""permanent changes to the tax system, which didn't need to be announced so quickly"", could have waited for OBR assessments and ""a full briefing from Treasury officials"".  Gerard Lyons, an economist who advised Ms Truss and Mr Kwarteng during the leadership contest, speaking on the BBC's World at One programme admitted that the mini-budget ""misread"" the country's financial situation. However, he argued that everything that has happened was not ""solely due to the mini-budget"" but also down to parts of the financial system that were vulnerable to interest rates going up. On 3 October, Mr Kwarteng U-turned on plans to scrap the top rate of income tax.  On 14 October, Ms Truss sacked Mr Kwarteng and announced a U-turn on corporation tax, confirming it will rise after all. On 17 October, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced that ""almost all"" the tax measures of the mini-budget will be reversed - apart from the National Insurance cut and the changes to stamp duty. The energy bills support scheme will last for six months, rather than two years.  What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Blackmore Bond collapse: FCA failed to act before people lost life savings,"Tue, 16 Aug 2022 12:32:45 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62504445,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62504445?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,BBC Panorama reveals evidence suggesting the FCA could have acted earlier before a fund collapsed.,"The financial watchdog has been accused of failing to act on warnings about a doomed property investment scheme that saw people lose their life savings. Some 2,000 people lost Â£46m when Blackmore Bond collapsed. It was claimed a marketing company had used suspect tactics to sell to ordinary people, not experienced investors. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) did not intervene for two years.   The FCA said it was not its duty to step in but MPs want an inquiry. The FCA's then chief Andrew Bailey - now head of the Bank of England - declined to comment. The bond was set up to invest money into UK property developments and the proceeds would supposedly pay back the investors. Blackmore was offering up to 10% per year in interest payments.  The scheme, known as a mini-bond, should by law only be sold to experienced investors, however it was marketed to ordinary people.  The bond collapsed in 2020 amid allegations of suspect sales tactics and inappropriate payments. Direct warnings about the tactics of a company marketing the Blackmore Bond were made to the FCA in 2017 and 2018.  An investigation for BBC Panorama reveals evidence suggesting the FCA could have acted earlier - and may have tried to cover up the fact it did not. Cross-party MPs, including members of the Treasury Select Committee, have called for an inquiry into the FCA's handling of the Blackmore Bond. Blackmore victim Paul Stevens, who was forced to retire from work due to an auto-immune disease called myasthenia gravis, invested his ill-health retirement benefit into the fund. He has been left devastated by the loss and says it has made his illness worse. ""Like many others, we invested a significant amount of money and, as a family, we lost Â£40,000,"" he said. ""These schemes must stop and the FCA needs to police them."" His wife, Jane, said: ""We feel as if we've been turned over twice - first by Blackmore, then by the FCA."" Panorama: The Billion-Pound Savings Scandal Each year, an estimated billion pounds is lost in failed investment schemes. Panorama tells the story of one of them as its member challenge the regulators they believe failed them Watch Now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) Paul Carlier, a finance and banking expert, first reported his concerns about the marketing of the Blackmore Bond to the FCA in 2017. His office at the time was next door to the company that was tasked with selling the bond. He overheard their activities and reported them for using high-pressure ""boiler room"" sales tactics, which are banned.  ""[The sales people] were literally cold-calling people and approaching people with an intent to sell them a toxic or worthless investment product, including the Blackmore Bond,"" he told BBC Panorama. Mr Carlier said the office walls were so thin he could hear their pushy techniques, as well as them clapping and high-fiving when they managed to make someone commit to investing.   In 2018, he learned that the sales company was still in operation and warned the FCA again, this time escalating the warning to the regulator's then chief executive, Mr Bailey. Mr Bailey now has a pivotal position managing the national economy, as head of the Bank of England. ""And yet another Â£10m-plus was invested after he was aware of it, through from the remainder of 2018 and into 2019,"" said Mr Carlier. ""It's astonishing. I don't know what more you could have done. I entrusted them to deal with it, and they didn't."" The FCA says it shared intelligence about the Blackmore Bond with the City of London Police in 2017 and forced the sales company to shut its website. In total, Â£30m was invested into the Blackmore fund after the first warning in 2017. When Mr Carlier again complained to the FCA about its lack of action, the regulator sent a draft response to him - he believes by mistake - which contained a sentence apparently admitting the FCA was at fault. The line said: ""However, I consider there was a missed opportunity to reconsider and act on the intelligence you provided.""  But this line had been crossed through, implying that Mr Carlier wasn't supposed to see it. He was only able to because someone had left the track-changes feature on, which showed a history of all edits to the documents.  ""Somebody has sought to conceal that,"" he told the BBC. ""That is the definition of a cover-up."" The FCA has denied that it attempted to cover up its actions and said the letter to Mr Carlier was changed because ""further evidence came to light"". MP Kevin Hollinrake, who sits on the Treasury Sub-Committee on Financial Services Regulations, is among those calling for fundamental reform of the regulator: ""I'd like to say this is a one-off case, but the reality is we see the succession of cases like this where the FCA has failed and it has failed here again."" He also criticised Mr Bailey and the FCA for its handling of other failed investment funds, such as London Capital and Finance, which collapsed in 2019, leading to 11,600 investors losing Â£237m. That failure led to an inquiry by former Court of Appeal Judge, Dame Elizabeth Gloster, and compensation for the victims. The MPs believe the same should happen in the case of Blackmore. Mr Stevens and other Blackmore Bond investors outlined how the fund's collapse had impacted them in front of MPs and members of the House of Lords at a special meeting in June. Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Susan Kramer said an inquiry was needed ""to deliver some justice for the people who, essentially, were scammed in an entirely public and, what should have been, regulated setting"". The BBC Panorama film also follows other Blackmore investors who, believing they had been abandoned by the authorities, set out to uncover evidence relating to Blackmore Bond themselves. The FCA and other authorities have not taken any action against the Blackmore directors, Phillip Nunn and Patrick McCreesh. The FCA has denied it was responsible for the Blackmore investors' losses. It said it was examining the way the bond's promotional material was approved, but said investors were warned of the risks and had to confirm they understood them and could afford to lose the money. Andrew Bailey declined to comment to Panorama on his performance at the FCA. Phillip Nunn, who has been bankrupted in connection with one Blackmore Bond development, did not reply to any of Panorama's questions, despite repeated requests. Patrick McCreesh denied any wrongdoing and said the Blackmore Bond was a potentially profitable, properly run business. He said the risks of investing were fully explained, vulnerable people were not targeted and Blackmore had stopped working with the sales company which had been reported to the FCA.  Mr McCreesh also admitted some business decisions were not right and apologised. He said he has suffered hardship and insists, as a director, he always acted properly and in the best interests of the business.

Two Twitter bosses ousted ahead of Elon Musk $44bn takeover,"Fri, 13 May 2022 02:34:25 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61432742,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61432742?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,One of the senior executives was on parental leave when he learned he was out of a job.,"Twitter has confirmed that two of its bosses are leaving the social media company in one of the biggest shake-ups since Elon Musk agreed to buy the firm. The executives had been leading Twitter's consumer and revenue operations. From this week, the firm has also paused most hiring, except for ""business critical roles"". The move comes as the multi-billionaire Tesla boss moves ahead with a $44bn (Â£36bn) takeover of the platform. ""We are pulling back on non-labour costs to ensure we are being responsible and efficient,"" a Twitter spokesperson told the BBC. Kayvon Beykpour, who led Twitter's consumer division, and Bruce Falck, who oversaw revenue, both tweeted on Thursday that the departures were not their decisions. Mr Beykpour said that he is currently on paternity leave and was disappointed after being asked to leave by Mr Parag, who ""wants to take the team in a different direction"". Allow Twitter content?

Jay Sullivan, who was leading the consumer unit during Mr Beykpour's leave, will become permanent head of the division. He will also oversee the revenue team until a new leader is appointed. This week, Mr Musk said he would reverse former US President Donald Trump's ban from Twitter if his takeover bid was successful. Appearing at an event on Tuesday he said: ""I would reverse the permanent ban but I don't own Twitter yet so this is not a thing that will definitely happen."" On Thursday, he tweeted: ""Even though I think a less divisive candidate would be better in 2024, I still think Trump should be restored to Twitter."" Mr Trump has said that he does not want to return to Twitter, but instead aims to build up his own Truth Social platform. He was banned from Twitter permanently in January 2021 because of the ""risk of further incitement of violence"" following the storming of the US Capitol, the company said then.

US Open 2022: Matt Fitzpatrick wins first major at Brookline Country Club,"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 01:20:19 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/golf/61855205,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/golf/61855205?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,England's Matt Fitzpatrick claims the US Open title with a one-shot victory at Brookline Country Club.,"This video can not be played Highlights: Brilliant Fitzpatrick wins US Open US Open Championship final leaderboard -6 M Fitzpatrick (Eng); -5 W Zalatoris (US), S Scheffler (US); -3 H Matsuyama (Jpn); -2 C Morikawa (US). R McIlroy (NI) Selected others: +1 J Rahm (Spa); +2 X Schauffele (US); +4 D Johnson (US); +7 J Thomas (US), J Rose (Eng), J Spieth (US); +12 B Koepka (US); +13 B DeChambeau (US) England's Matt Fitzpatrick was swamped by his family after superbly holding off the world's best players to claim his first major title with a one-shot victory in the US Open at Brookline. The 27-year-old was also hugged by Rory McIlroy on the 18th green as he became just the third Englishman in 52 years to win the sport's second oldest major. Fitzpatrick shot a two-under 68 for a six-under total to beat world number one Scottie Scheffler (67) and Will Zalatoris (69) in a gripping battle that went to the final hole.  ""It's what you grow up dreaming of,"" said Fitzpatrick. ""It's something I've worked so hard for for such a long time. I've got to give myself credit: I had so much patience."" His win will be remembered for the stunning shot he played from a fairway bunker on the 18th. In scenes reminiscent of Sandy Lyle's final-hole bunker shot on his way to winning the 1988 Masters at Augusta National, Fitzpatrick launched a high cut at the green, the ball landing 20 feet beyond the flag and spinning a couple of feet closer. A two-putt par was then enough to spark scenes of sheer jubilation as his mum, dad and brother embraced him on the green. Sheffield-born Fitzpatrick, who also won the US Amateur title at Brookline back in 2013 joins Jack Nicklaus as the only two men to win both that and the US Open at the same venue - Nicklaus achieved the feat at Pebble Beach.   He is also the first non-American to win both titles.  And he joins 1970 champion Tony Jacklin and 2013 victor Justin Rose as modern-day English winners of the US Open. He is the first British winner of a men's major since Danny Willett at the 2016 Masters. Key shot to US Open win was hit and hope - Fitzpatrick Final US Open leaderboard Both Fitzpatrick and Zalatoris went close at last month's US PGA Championship and despite neither of them having won on the PGA Tour before this week, they did not flinch during a titanic struggle on a tense final day. Matt Fitzpatrick wins his first major at the US Open Masters champion Scheffler, defending champion Jon Rahm and world number three McIlroy were all within striking distance of joint overnight leaders Fitzpatrick and Zalatoris at the start of the final round in Massachusetts. But while Rahm and McIlroy's challenges faltered, Scheffler powered into the lead with four birdies in his first six holes as he looked to become just the sixth man to win the Masters and US Open in the same year, and only the second man after Tiger Woods to win this major while sitting top of the world rankings. Fitzpatrick answered with birdies on the third and fifth holes while a nervy looking Zalatoris had two bogeys to slip four shots behind the leading duo. However, two stunning irons shots led to successive birdies on the sixth and seventh holes to spark 25-year-old Zalatoris into life, and when Scheffler hit trouble around the turn and Fitzpatrick missed two short putts, all of a sudden it was Zalatoris who led by two. A huge turning point came on the 13th, though, when Fitzpatrick holed a 48-foot birdie putt to tie Zalatoris, who made a clutch par save from 12 feet. Scheffler was always lurking, but the final pair looked determined that one of them would become the 14th first-time major winner to lift the US Open trophy in the past 18 years - it was just a case of who would land that knockout blow. On the 15th, Fitzpatrick moved two clear when he made a birdie and Zalatoris a bogey, but the American cut that advantage in half with a birdie on 17 after yet another laser of an iron shot. More drama came on the final hole. Fitzpatrick hit his tee shot into a fairway bunker but the Englishman escaped brilliantly and although a two-putt par left Zalatoris needing a birdie to force a play-off, the Texan was unable to hole his effort. You would not have bet against extra holes given all three previous US Opens held at Brookline have been decided by play-offs. But Zalatoris' effort slid agonisingly wide and as he slumped to his knees, Fitzpatrick and his caddie Billy Foster embraced. It was more major agony for Zalatoris though, who finished as runner-up for the second major in a row after losing to Justin Thomas in a play-off at the US PGA Championship.  Matt Fitzpatrick hits the shot that clinched his US Open title from the fairway bunker on 18 Fitzpatrick hit 17 of 18 greens in regulation in a stunning display of control and consistency, but the shot he will be remembered for is his remarkable recovery shot from the bunker on 18. ""If there's one shot I just did not want this year it's a fairway bunker shot,"" said Fitzpatrick. ""When I saw it leave the sand I couldn't be happier.""  Fitzpatrick and his family have stayed with the same American family in Boston that hosted him for his 2013 US Amateur victory - with the familiarity of the situation having a positive impact throughout the week.  ""It's meant the world,"" Fitzpatrick added.  ""I've obviously won here twice now. I'm trying to get every tour event round here. To stay with them this week has made it so much more relaxing. There's no pressure and I've loved every minute of it.""  Rory McIlroy had yet another top-10 finish at the US Open While Rahm saw his challenge fizzle out with a final-round 74, it was another missed chance for McIlroy to add to his four major titles after an eight-year drought.  McIlroy could never find any consistency in his one-under 69, following all of his three front-nine birdies with bogeys. Two late birdies pushed him up into a tied-fifth finish.  It is a 16th top-10 finish, eight of them top five, in the 29 majors McIlroy has played since winning his last one in 2014 - and although frustrated he is trying to remain positive. ""I'll look back at this as another missed opportunity just as Southern Hills was, but missed opportunities are better than not contending at all, "" said McIlroy.  ""So that is a positive. I have to stay patient at this point because if I just keep putting myself in position, sooner or later it's going to be my day and I'm going to get one.""  Billy Foster has previously caddied for Seve Ballesteros, Lee Westwood and Darren Clarke Among the scenes of unbridled joy on the 18th green, Fitzpatrick's veteran caddie Foster was arguably more emotional than his boss as he finally enjoyed a major victory after 40 years of carrying the bags of some of the sport's biggest stars.  Foster has been on the bag of the likes of Seve Ballesteros, Lee Westwood and Darren Clarke and never won a major, and the usually stoic Yorkshireman was overcome with emotion.  ""It's unbelievably emotional,"" Foster told Sky Sports. ""I'm glad someone has got that giant monkey off my back.  ""It means a lot. Lee Westwood, Darren Clarke, Seve, they've had their chances over the years and (Thomas) Bjorn.   ""I was caddying for him that day when he left it in the bunker at Sandwich [in 2003] and that really hurt. I thought about it for six months and it broke my heart. That has put a lot of bad memories to bed. It means everything.  ""I knew he was good enough to win a major and this week he has played unbelievable and he's not putted his best, which is incredible really. ""He did my head in missing a few short putts,"" he laughed. ""He didn't need to win by four. One was enough."" Are the risks of vaping starting to show?

War in Ukraine: World Bank approves $723m financial package,"Tue, 08 Mar 2022 01:58:44 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60657127,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60657127?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The package of financial support for Ukraine includes a $100m pledge from the UK.,"The World Bank has approved $723m (Â£551m) in loans and grants for Ukraine, as the country fights against a Russian invasion. The bank said it is continuing to work on another $3bn package of support in the coming months for the country. It also promised extra help for neighbouring countries that are taking in more than 1.7m refugees, which are mostly women, children and the elderly. The financial package for Ukraine includes a $100m pledge from the UK. ""The World Bank Group is taking quick action to support Ukraine and its people in the face of the violence and extreme disruption caused by the Russian invasion,"" the bank's president David Malpass said in a statement.  The bank said the funds would help Ukraine's government provide critical services, including wages for hospital workers, pensions for the elderly and social programmes for the vulnerable. The package includes a $350m loan, augmented by about $139m through guarantees from the Netherlands and Sweden. It is also made up of $134m in grants from Britain, Denmark, Latvia, Lithuania and Iceland, as well as $100m of financing from Japan. Last week, Mr Malpass told the BBC that the war was ""a catastrophe"" for the world which will cut global economic growth. ""The war in Ukraine comes at a bad time for the world because inflation was already rising,"" he said. He stressed that his biggest concern was ""about the pure human loss of lives"".

Tory leadership: Who gets to choose the UK's next prime minister?,"Thu, 14 Jul 2022 15:59:42 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-62138041,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-62138041?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"They are older, more male and better off than the UK average. What else do we know about Tory members?","Conservative MPs are currently battling it out to replace Boris Johnson as their leader and our next prime minister - but it is the party membership that will get the final say.  So who are they? There won't be a general election when Boris Johnson stands down as prime minister, because the Conservative Party is already in power.  And so it falls to Tory party members to select the next PM in a postal ballot from a shortlist of two chosen by MPs. We don't know exactly how many members the party has because they won't tell us, but it is over 160,000, or about 0.3% of the total UK electorate. Like members of the other major parties, Tories tend to be older, more middle class and more white than the rest of the population. Professor Tim Bale, head of Queen Mary University of London and Sussex University Party Members Project, says: ""The people who get to choose our next prime minister are far from being representative of voters as a whole. ""They're not as diverse ethnically; they're heavily concentrated in the south of England; there are significantly more men than women; they're generally better off; and, although they're not quite as elderly as some imagine (on average they're actually in their late 50s even if four-in-10 are over 65), they're still relatively old. ""In short, what political scientists call 'the selectorate' looks pretty different to the electorate.""  According to the most recent research by Prof Bale's team, from January 2020: In 2017, the average age of Conservative party members was 57, Labour 53, Lib Dems 52 and SNP 54, according to Commons library research. All the main parties have relatively few black and minority ethnic members. According to a 2018 report by Tim Bale's team, 97% of Conservative members were ""white British"", compared with 96% for Labour and the Liberal Democrats.  Labour is closer to gender parity than the other parties, and it has far more members overall than the Conservatives, even though the number has declined since Sir Keir Starmer took over as leader (as of July last year it stood at 440,000). Most members of most parties in the UK are pretty middle-class, according to Prof Bale's research, but Conservative Party members are the most middle-class of all. In marked contrast to Labour and the Lib Dems, nearly 40% of Conservative members earn more than the national average, and one in 20 earns more than Â£100,000 a year, which, says Tim Bale, is all the more striking because of how many Tories are of pensionable age. The Conservatives are the only major UK party to not routinely release membership figures.  A Conservative Party press officer said: ""There were 160,000 eligible members during the previous leadership election. There will be more members this time."" This 2019 leadership election figure is a slight exaggeration, according to House of Commons library research, which said 159,320 Tory members were eligible to vote in that contest. Amanda Milling, who was Tory chairwoman at the time, claimed in a March 2021 Daily Telegraph interview that party membership had topped 200,000, largely thanks to a dramatic rise in Wales, the north-east and south-west of England. A lot has happened in British politics since then, not least the pandemic and the series of scandals, including a police fine for breaking his own lockdown laws, that led to the downfall of Boris Johnson. It costs Â£25 a year to join the Conservative Party, although there are big discounts for members of the armed forces and those aged under 26. But anyone hoping to sign up to get a say in who will be the next prime minister - or to make mischief with the process - is out of luck. You have to have been a paid-up member for three months to take part in the leadership ballot, by which time a new occupant will be safely ensconced in Number 10.

Met officers sacked for racist Meghan WhatsApp post,"Fri, 01 Jul 2022 18:28:41 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-62016109,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-62016109?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"The messages PC Sukhdev Jeer and PC Paul Hefford sent damaged the Met's reputation, the hearing heard.","Two Met Police officers have been sacked for making ""abhorrent"" comments in a group chat, including a racist joke about the Duchess of Sussex. A tribunal heard PC Sukhdev Jeer and PC Paul Hefford, who worked at Bethnal Green police in east London, posted the messages on WhatsApp in 2018. It found they had committed gross misconduct. The hearing was told the messages mocked the people the officers were supposed to be policing. The tribunal heard details of several racist posts, including one containing a racist slur about the Duchess of Sussex shortly before her marriage to Prince Harry. Chairman Maurice Cohen said they were ""highly corrosive and discriminatory"" to members of the public ""including those in the local community"" they served. The hearing also heard the pair failed to report offensive messages they received from other members of the group. At an earlier hearing, Mr Cohen said: ""The postings in this group caused serious reputational damage to the Metropolitan Police as a whole."" He added that the content was posted over an ""extended period of time"" and that the officers should have been aware of their ""unacceptable nature"". PC Jeer had previously told the hearing he was ""not in a good place"" and had used the language to cope with the ""issues"" he had been experiencing.  Barrister Ben Summers had argued he should not be dismissed over a ""handful of inappropriate jokes"" which caused ""limited harm"" and said he should receive a warning instead of being sacked. Michael Shaw, representing PC Hefford, said the officer found his posts ""embarrassing and difficult"" and had learned a ""sad lesson"". Vishal Misra, representing the Met, said: ""The panel has found the postings were abhorrent and discriminatory in nature and the damage it has done to public confidence is substantial and far-reaching."" Mr Misra also said ""trust once lost is not easily regained"", adding the men's dismissal was required to maintain public confidence in the force.

Atletico Madrid 0-0 Man City (agg: 0-1): Mature City hold off Atletico in fiery encounter to reach semis,"Wed, 13 Apr 2022 21:54:42 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61086835,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61086835?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Manchester City produce a mature and disciplined performance to hold off the challenge of Atletico Madrid and reach the Champions League semi-finals.," Last updated on 13 April 202213 April 2022.From the section European Footballcomments2275 Manchester City produced a mature and disciplined performance to hold off the challenge of Atletico Madrid - and set up a Champions League semi-final showdown with the Spanish side's city rivals Real. Knowing a clean sheet would be enough to seal the tie, City kept their cool in the face of a hostile home crowd and intimidation from a physical Atleti side showing far more ambition than in the first leg. Ilkay Gundogan could have made life much easier for Pep Guardiola's men by slotting in from close range, instead of against the post in the first half. But in the face of much-increased pressure and a home side pushing desperately for parity, City put up a resolute rearguard action to confirm their progression to the last four. Atletico ended the fiery contest with 10 men when defender Felipe was shown a second yellow card for a dangerous follow-through on Phil Foden, having also caught the same player with an arm that drew blood from the England international's head earlier in the game. Real Madrid, who edged past Chelsea in a thrilling quarter-final tie on Tuesday, now stand between City and a second successive appearance in the final of Europe's premier club competition. Having lost to Thomas Tuchel's Blues in last season's final, Guardiola's side are seeking a maiden Champions League title in a campaign where they are still challenging on three fronts. They lead the Premier League by one point from second-placed Liverpool - and face Jurgen Klopp's Reds in an FA Cup semi-final this Saturday. City have grown accustomed to controlling games of football at this level, strangling the life out of teams through sheer volume of possession before surgically picking them off in what are often benign, one-sided encounters. For 45 minutes here, though, they were given a taste of their own medicine and forced to dig deep against extreme pressure from an increasingly desperate opponent, whose ill-discipline in stoppage time should could easily have resulted in further red cards. It is a huge feather in City's cap that they were able to hold firm against repeated attacks and then keep their heads as Atletico were losing theirs. It is a shame that the credit the home side's attacking display deserved was largely overshadowed by their unnecessary antics. They included a potential headbutt from former City centre-back Stefan Savic on Raheem Sterling - and hair pull on Jack Grealish - during an unsavoury melee involving both sets of players and the two benches after Felipe's foul on Foden. Clashes also continued at full-time as both sets of players made their way down the tunnel. Prior to this, the 90 minutes had showcased a different approach from the Spanish champions in comparison to a first leg in which they operated largely in a 5-5-0 formation and failed to muster a single effort on goal. Roared on by a vociferous home crowd, they pressed fiercely, harrying the City players all over the pitch. Having stayed in the tie for three quarters of it - with Geoffrey Kondogbia's blocked 35th-minute effort their solitary shot across both legs - the hosts came out swinging for the second period. Antoine Griezmann went close, as did Rodrigo de Paul, Matheus Cunha and Luis Suarez, as boss Diego Simeone threw every attacking option he had onto the field in the hope of breaking the visitors down. But this is not an easily intimidated City side, nor does their elite attacking prowess come at the expense of defensive frailty, even when injury affected Kevin de Bruyne and Kyle Walker and forced the introduction of Nathan Ake. John Stones was immense, with a block to deny a Cunha effort from close range the highlight of an intelligent and dogged display. Keeper Ederson was also called upon for a heroic moment, saving superbly to stop Angel Correa's shot after the ball had broken to the Atletico man in the box in the 11th minute of added time. Celebrations were mixed among the confrontations at full-time, but City have little time to rest after this epic energy-sapping encounter. Saturday sees them face Liverpool in the FA Cup semi and, two weeks from now, Real will visit the Etihad.

UK economy shrinks as outlook on recession darkens,"Fri, 12 Aug 2022 12:51:44 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62504789,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62504789?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The economy shrank by 0.1% leading some experts to warn a recession could start sooner than expected.,"The UK economy shrank between April and June as experts forecast a gloomy outlook with recession on the horizon. The economy contracted by 0.1% in the second quarter of the year, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. This was partly due to Covid schemes like Test and Trace ending, retail sales falling and the Queen's Platinum Jubilee bank holiday in June, it said. The Bank of England has forecast the UK will fall into recession towards the end of the year as energy costs soar.  Despite shrinking between April and June, the UK economy avoided recession because gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.8% in the first three months of this year. A recession is defined as the economy getting smaller for two consecutive three-month periods.  Up until now most economists - and the Bank of England - did not expect a recession to begin until the final three months of 2022.  Many expected a small rebound in economic growth between July and September. But the latest figures from the ONS have prompted some experts to warn that recession could come sooner than they had initially thought. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research said it expected the UK economy to continue falling over the next three quarters. Capital Economics said there was now a greater risk that the economy will shrink by 0.2% between July and September before worsening. But investment bank Goldman Sachs still predicted growth of 0.4% in the third quarter of 2022. A spokesperson said: ""We had previously assumed a sharp bounce back in July but now expect a more muted rebound."" HSBC's forecast was more positive, it said: ""If the UK is going into recession, then we don't think this is the start of it."" ""We still expect a bounce back in July - the reversal of the bank holiday effect - to set the UK up for a positive Q3, as does the Bank of England,"" it added. Kingdom Thenga, who owns a number of local bars and restaurants in Chester, says for him, it already feels like the UK is in a recession. ""I think we are not too far away from it because of the consistent blows we're getting from energy bills, from people not going out, to the cost of living, it just seems that's where we're heading,"" he said. He says his business is currently ""in survival mode"". ""It's not about making money, it's not about trying to expand or trying to grow our business, it's just about stabilising the business especially after the pandemic over the last two years,"" he told the BBC.  Mr Thenga says the biggest issue he's facing is rising costs - with everything from poultry to vegetable oil soaring in price - while the amount of money his customers have in their pockets is going down. ""Energy bills are ridiculous, the cost of fuel is ridiculous and I appreciate people don't necessarily have the money or can't spend what they used to, because everyone is so worried about what the bills are going to be,"" he says. The UK is facing the worst rate of price rises - or inflation - in 40 years as energy costs continue to soar. Commenting on the 0.1% contraction between April and June, the ONS said that the biggest contributor was from ""human health and social work activities"" as Covid test and trace and vaccination programmes were wound down. There was also a fall in retail sales volumes. However, it said areas such as tourism, bars and entertainment showed strong growth. ""Health was the biggest reason the economy contracted as both the test and trace and vaccine programmes were wound down, while many retailers also had a tough quarter,"" said Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS. ""These were partially offset by growth in hotels, bars, hairdressers and outdoor events across the quarter, partly as a result of people celebrating the Platinum Jubilee."" This included rises in mobile food stands and takeaway food shops.  The ONS said that in June alone the economy shrank by 0.6% in June due to the extra bank holiday to celebrate the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. However, that figure was much better than the 1.3% fall predicted by economists. The ONS said that while the bank holiday impacted on monthly GDP, it had ""little impact"" on the quarterly figure. The Chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, told the BBC that these are ""challenging times"". ""What the numbers show today is that the contraction is partly because of some of the Covid activities reducing but also real resilience in the private sector which actually in many ways bodes well... But nevertheless these are challenging times,"" he said. But Labour accused the Conservatives of ""losing control of the economy"". Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: ""With the Bank of England forecasting a recession lasting the whole of next year, the Conservative leadership contenders need to stop playing to the gallery and start coming up with a serious plan to get Britain's economy back on track."" A big part of the drop in Gross Domestic Product in June was because of the Platinum Jubilee - which meant two fewer working days of producing goods and services, in contrast to May, which had one additional working day. It was always expected that that would magnify the downswing from May to June and economists expected a sharper drop in activity. The 0.1% drop over the three months from April to June was only half as bad as some economists thought. Nevertheless, given the backdrop of the global squeeze on incomes due to soaring energy prices, no-one can say this drop in activity is just a blip. The squeeze on the hard-pressed consumer is tightening its grip, with activity in consumer-facing services down by 4.9% compared to before the pandemic. And with France, Italy and Canada seeing growth, no-one can say this is a stellar economic performance. All in all, it's not yet the recession the Bank of England has forecast: more a precursor.

"Ukraine war: Russia railway station strike kills 22, injures dozens","Wed, 24 Aug 2022 22:15:00 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-62666188,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-62666188?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,A deadly attack on passenger carriages and a warning of disaster mark six months since Russia's invasion.,"A Russian rocket strike on a railway station killed 25 people, Ukraine says, on the day marking six months since Moscow's invasion began. Five of the victims of the attack in the eastern town of Chaplyne burnt to death in a vehicle, officials said. Two boys aged six and 11 were also killed. President Volodymyr Zelensky reported the strike during a UN Security Council meeting. A further 31 people were hurt. Russia said it hit a military train killing hundreds of Ukrainian troops. ""As a result of a direct hit by an Iskander missile on a military train at the Chaplyne railway station in the Dnipropetrovsk region, more than 200 servicemen of the reserve of Ukraine's Armed Forces and 10 units of military equipment were destroyed, on their way to combat zones in the Donbas,"" its defence ministry said in a statement. Ukraine has made no mention of military deaths in the strike. Moscow has repeatedly denied targeting civilian infrastructure. Speaking on Thursday, UN human rights commissioner Michelle Bachelet called on Russia's president to halt armed attacks on Ukraine. Mr Zelensky said he had learned of the strike on Chaplyne, in the Dnipropetrovsk region, as he was preparing to speak to the Security Council, adding: ""This is how Russia prepared for the UN Security Council meeting."" In April, a strike on another train station killed more than 50 people. Ukraine spent Wednesday marking its annual independence day. Mr Zelensky had previously said Russia might do something ""cruel"" to disrupt the celebrations. Earlier, he accused Moscow's forces of turning the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant into a ""war zone"" that endangered the plant and the people of Europe, putting the world ""on the brink of radiation catastrophe"".   On Thursday the city of Enerhodar, where the plant is located, was ""on the verge of a humanitarian disaster"" after being left without electricity and water ""as a result of enemy shelling"", its exiled Mayor Dmytro Orlov said on Telegram. It is not clear whether these outages have affected the nuclear plant. Russian media reported quoting Russian-installed authorities that the occupied cities of Melitopol and Kherson, and other population centres in Kherson region, were without power. Around the world, there were gatherings of supporters in the streets on Wednesday to mark Ukraine's independence. World leaders also rallied to support the embattled nation. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson appeared in Kyiv on an unannounced trip to show his country's support, announcing Â£54m ($63.5m) in new military aid - a figure dwarfed by an announcement from US President Joe Biden of an extra $3bn (Â£2.5bn).  But in the streets of Kyiv, it was relatively quiet. Ukraine had banned large gatherings and events over fears that Russia could target such civilian gatherings. It followed a warning from the US for any of its citizens to leave ahead of the anniversary.  Some gathered anyway on Khreshchatyk Street to look at the array of captured Russian tanks and armoured vehicles put on display instead of the usual Ukrainian parade. Between his political speeches, President Zelensky and his wife also attended a memorial ceremony for the fallen soldiers and civilians of the war, laying yellow and blue flowers at Kyiv's Memory Wall of Fallen Defenders.

Ukraine war: Alarm over reports Ukrainian POWs face trial in cages,"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 17:20:10 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-62651344,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-62651344?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Photos posted on social media appear to show metal cages being built in Mariupol's concert hall.,"The UN Human Rights Office says it is concerned by reports that Russia plans to try Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) in Russian-occupied Mariupol. A UN spokeswoman said there was evidence that metal cages were being built in the Ukrainian city's concert hall, ""apparently to restrain prisoners of war during proceedings."" The UN said prosecuting POWs for taking part in hostilities is a war crime. Russia has previously denied unfairly treating prisoners of war. Photos posted on social media in recent days - including by Ukrainian authorities - appear to show metal cages being built on the stage of the city's philharmonic hall. The BBC has verified that the photos match the interior of the venue and were taken within the last four to five days. Ukraine's intelligence service has alleged that Russia is planning to hold show trials of Ukrainian POWs captured while defending the city before it fell to Russian forces in May. Speaking at a press briefing, a spokeswoman for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ravina Shamdasani, said ""apparently the idea is to restrain the prisoners of war during proceedings in these cages,"" adding that such plans were ""not acceptable"" and ""humiliating"". ""We recall that international humanitarian law prohibits the establishment of courts solely to judge prisoners of war and that wilfully depriving a prisoner of war of the rights of fair and regular trial amounts to a war crime,"" Ms Shamdasani said in a UN statement released on Tuesday. More on the Ukraine conflict: She added that the UN is concerned that if POWs are charged with crimes, they will not receive a fair trial. Ms Shamdasani also expressed concern over Russia denying Ukrainian POWs access to independent monitors such as the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which she said could expose them to the risk of being tortured to extract a confession.

PrettyLittleThing Marketplace app: Greenwashing or a step forward?,"Fri, 02 Sep 2022 14:42:01 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-62766792,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-62766792?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"The fast fashion giant's new Marketplace app has led some people to accuse it of ""greenwashing"".","In what appears to be a move away from fast fashion, PrettyLittleThing have launched an app which will allow customers to re-sell their old clothes. Earlier this week, the fashion giant announced Indiyah Polack - one of this year's Love Island finalists - as the first PLT Marketplace ambassador.  The 23-year-old will be selling some of her own outfits on the site, and in a statement said the app's focus on re-wearing and re-selling was ""something that's important to [her]"".  Some have seen it as a positive move from the brand, which might encourage more young people to shop second hand.  But there has been a backlash, and many have accused PLT of ""greenwashing"" - marketing designed to make customers believe your company is doing more to protect the environment than it really is. Brett Staniland, who was on Love Island last year, agrees.  Even before his time on the show, the 28-year-old model has taken a stance against fast fashion. While on the series, he refused to wear clothes from the show's then sponsor, I Saw It First. Last year, he protested outside a PrettyLittleThing catwalk show put on by the brand's creative director and fellow former Islander Molly-Mae Hague.  Brett tells Radio 1 Newsbeat that he thinks PLT are putting the onus on consumers to be more environmentally friendly.  ""When I saw the announcement, it was a massive eye roll,"" he says. ""It was interesting for me to see PLT announcing that this is how they're going to be more ethically responsible.  ""But they were essentially just placing all the responsibility on the consumers."" RonaÃ© Fagon, a 30-year-old fashion consultant, says the app doesn't do anything to tackle wider issues within the industry, such as working conditions - something PLT's parent company Boohoo has faced criticism over. ""Unless they go deeper and deal with the actual issue of their overproduction, heavy use of oil-derived materials, exploitation of workers in their supply chains and quality of their garments, it's not even scratching the surface,"" she says.  But, despite its critics, the site - which isn't just limited to PLT clothes - might encourage some shoppers to think about making more sustainable fashion choices.  TikTok influencer Victoria Wright, 26, says it's a ""step in the right direction"".   ""Having someone like Indiyah champion it is great, because she's got an amazing fashion sense,"" she says.  ""It'll encourage young people to get online and buy second hand, rather than go out and buy new."" PrettyLittleThing said in a statement: ""Our customers told us they want simple and easy ways to give their old clothes a new lease of life and make some money for themselves in the process.  ""PrettyLittleThing Marketplace is a community platform that will allow people to do just that.  ""We are all about making fashion more diverse and inclusive, giving our customers the creative freedom to express themselves.  ""With the PLT Marketplace App, it is now even easier to join our'PLTLoved movement as we all play our part in reducing waste."" Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

Nick Kyrgios seeks dismissal of assault case on mental health grounds,"Tue, 04 Oct 2022 00:56:22 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-63126431,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-63126431?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The tennis player - who is accused of assaulting an ex-partner - cites his struggles with mental health.,"Lawyers for Australian tennis star Nick Kyrgios have said they will apply to have an assault charge against him dismissed on mental health grounds. Kyrgios, who is currently playing in the Japan Open in Tokyo, was not required to attend the hearing in Canberra on Tuesday. The charge against the 27-year-old relates to an alleged assault in December 2021 on a former partner.  If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of two years in prison. Kyrgios's lawyer Michael Kukulies-Smith said he was making the application having reviewed his client's ""medical history since 2015, including public disclosures of his mental health struggles"". Under section 334 of the Australian Capital Territory's Crimes Act, the magistrates court has the power to dismiss a case if it is satisfied the accused is mentally impaired and the facts or other relevant evidence supports the person being dealt with under this rule. However, the bar for a case to be thrown out on these grounds is high, and needs approval from the director of public prosecutions.  A hearing on the application will take place on 3 February. Mr Kukulies-Smith told Magistrate Glenn Theakston that his client's work meant he spent large periods of time overseas. But it was Kyrgios's preference for the hearing to take place as soon as possible and for him to attend in person, the ACT Magistrates Court heard. The tennis star, currently ranked number 20 in the world, has spoken openly about his mental health struggles in the past, including in posts on Instagram. This week he insisted that the looming court case was not making it difficult to focus on his tennis.

Ed Sheeran hits out at culture of 'baseless' copyright claims after court victory,"Wed, 06 Apr 2022 16:55:39 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-61008849,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-61008849?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"The singer says pop stars are easy targets in what has become a ""really damaging"" culture in music.","Ed Sheeran has warned that pop stars should not be allowed to be ""easy targets"" for copyright claims after winning his court battle with the writers of a song they claimed he had plagiarised. A High Court judge ruled that the singer had not copied part of his hit, Shape of You, from Oh Why, by Sami Chokri. That prompted Sheeran to declare on Instagram: ""I hope that this ruling means in the future baseless claims like this can be avoided. ""This really does have to end."" The case was not the first time Sheeran has faced a copyright claim, and many other stars have also been involved in high-profile disputes in recent years. Last month, Katy Perry won a case on appeal after a rapper said she had plagiarised an eight-note riff for her 2013 hit Dark Horse. Dua Lipa has recently been sued twice over her song Levitating, the biggest-selling single in the US last year. Those claims have come from the writers behind Latin disco band Dr Buzzard's Original Savannah Band and Florida reggae group Artikal Sound System. Also last month, Sam Smith and Normani were sued over their 2019 duet Dancing With A Stranger, while Taylor Swift is facing a trial over her 2014 anthem Shake It Off. As the music industry saying goes, where there's a hit, there's a writ.  The field of music copyright ""has become like the Wild West"", says forensic musicologist Peter Oxendale, who worked with Sheeran in this latest case. He says cases have proliferated since 2015, when Blurred Lines creators Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams were found guilty in the US of copying the ""feel"" of Marvin Gaye's Got To Give It Up, rather than directly plagiarising musical phrases or lyrics. ""In that case, [there] wasn't even two notes in common, and yet it found in favour of the wrong side,"" Oxendale told BBC Radio 4's The World At One. Part of the melody in Shape of You did bear some similarity to a segment of Oh Why - but Sheeran successfully argued in the High Court that it was a coincidence and he had not heard the other song before. This video can not be played Watch Ed Sheeran's Shape of You and Sami Chokri's Oh Why Sheeran took legal action after Switch - real name Sami Chokri - and fellow songwriter Ross O'Donoghue asked to be added to the songwriting credits for Shape of You, which is the most streamed song ever on Spotify. However, the judge ruled that Sheeran would be justified in thinking their request ""was a tactic designed to extract a settlement"" - in other words, money and/or a credit without going to court. Sheeran said: ""I feel like claims like this are way too common now and have become a culture where a claim is made with the idea that a settlement will be cheaper than taking it to court, even if there's no basis for the claim. ""It's really damaging to the songwriting industry. There's only so many notes and very few chords used in pop music. Coincidence is bound to happen if 60,000 songs are being released every day on Spotify. That's 22 million songs a year, and there's only 12 notes that are available."" Allow Instagram content?

Sheeran's plea for an end to ""baseless claims"" will find sympathetic ears among other musicians. ""It should never have got as far as it did,"" Grammy-winning composer David Arnold wrote of the Sheeran case. ""Hopefully this result brings about a change in the avalanche of frivolous speculative copyright infringement cases."" But Wednesday's ruling won't bring copyright cases to an end. It won't even bring cases against Ed Sheeran to an end. He's facing another trial in the US after being sued for $100m (Â£76m) by the owner of a share of the songwriting rights to Marvin Gaye's Let's Get It On, who claims Sheeran copied it for his 2014 chart-topper Thinking Out Loud. He has also settled cases out of court in the past. In 2018, he paid $5.4m (Â£4.1m) to songwriters Thomas Leonard and Martin Harrington after being accused of copying their track Amazing (which was released by X Factor winner Matt Cardle in 2012) for Sheeran's 2015 song, Photograph. In the latest trial, the star said he had been ""bruised"" by that experience. Even though he felt he had done nothing wrong, he said he had agreed to pay out on the advice of his lawyers because it would have been a ""nuisance"" and ""more trouble than it was worth"" to fight. After the Shape of You ruling, Oxendale said: ""I'm full of admiration for Ed Sheeran in this case because he could easily have taken the easy way out, which is just to give them a nuisance payment to go away. ""But he didn't. He chose to fight it and fighting cases in the High Court is traumatic for anyone. It's difficult. It's really expensive. It's time-consuming."" Sheeran had already given the writers of TLC's 1999 hit No Scrubs a credit on Shape of You several years ago after similarities were pointed out. In recent years, more stars have given the composers of potentially problematic tracks credits before a dispute gets anywhere near a court. Taylor Swift famously credited 1990s British pop duo Right Said Fred on her 2017 single Look What You Made Me Do because it follows the same rhythmic pattern as I'm Too Sexy. Last year, Olivia Rodrigo added two members of Paramore to the writing credits of Good 4 U, and the number of writers on Uptown Funk, by Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars, ballooned from six to 11 when The Gap Band noticed similarities to their song Oops Upside Your Head. Part of Chokri and O'Donoghue's complaint was that Sheeran treats unknown songwriters worse than famous ones when it comes to giving credits - which he denied. But the case rested on the fact that he insisted he had never heard their song, so could not have copied it either consciously or subconsciously - which would have been more difficult to argue if Oh Why had been a hit. Copyright lawyer Kate Swaine says: ""If I was advising somebody who's been accused of copyright infringement, the first thing I would ask them is, 'Is there a possibility that you could have, unconsciously or consciously, been influenced, inspired or taken an element of this?' ""If somebody turns around and says, 'I do know that track really well. I have heard it. It's not out of the question,' they may feel that, rather than getting into the cost and disruption of a court action, it is easier to make a concession and therefore give some credit on the royalties. ""Here, what comes across from Sheeran's evidence is he was absolutely adamant that he had not heard this track."" She sees little chance of the number of copyright claims subsiding.

Mohammed Bin Salman: Saudi prince's controversial invitation to the Queen's funeral,"Sat, 17 Sep 2022 13:31:13 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-62940906,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-62940906?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Human rights campaigners say it is a stain on Queen Elizabeth II's memory.,"The UK's invitation to Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed Bin Salman, to attend the Queen's funeral has sparked a storm of protest from human rights campaigners.  A declassified CIA report concluded that the crown prince had authorised the murder and dismemberment of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul in 2018. The Saudi crown prince and his government denied this, but he has been seen as something of a pariah in the West and has not been to Britain since. Until now.  Sources close to the Saudi Embassy confirmed the prince, known as ""MBS"", would be coming to London this weekend, but it was unclear if he would attend the actual funeral on Monday. Hatice Gengiz, the fiancÃ©e of the murdered Saudi journalist, said the invitation was a stain on the memory of Queen Elizabeth II. She called for him to be arrested when he lands in London, although she doubted this would happen. The pressure group Campaign Against the Arms Trade (CAAT) has accused Saudi Arabia and other Gulf monarchies of using the Queen's funeral as a way to - in their words - ""whitewash"" their human rights records.  The group estimates that since the start of the disastrous war in Yemen eight years ago, Britain has sold the Saudi-led coalition fighting there more than $23bn worth of arms.  Scant political freedoms have also disappeared completely since MBS became crown prince in 2017, with hefty prison sentences handed down to critics of government, even just for social media posts. At the same time, paradoxically, the crown prince has embarked on a massive programme of social liberalisation. Cinemas and public entertainment, long banned in the Kingdom for being deemed ""un-Islamic"", have reopened.  On MBS's orders, women are now allowed to drive and the desert kingdom has played host to international sporting and music events, including a concert by the DJ David Guetta.  Saudi Arabia, despite its heavily-criticised human rights record, remains a staunch ally of Britain in the Gulf, where it is seen by the West as a bulwark against Iran's aggressive expansionism.  It buys western weapons, employs thousands of expatriate workers, hosts the annual Hajj pilgrimage and helps to steady the oil price. All of which partly explain why international criticism of the crown prince is muted at most.

The Papers: 'Anger as fans boo William' and 'Rishi ready to help',"Sun, 15 May 2022 01:14:20 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-the-papers-61452948,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-the-papers-61452948?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The papers cover outrage after the FA Cup final and the chancellor's promise to help with the cost of living.,"The Sunday Telegraph reports that Cabinet ministers have ""turned on"" the Bank of England for failing to keep inflation at the target rate of 2%. Senior ministers are quoted as saying the Bank had ""one job"".  In its leader column, the Telegraph calls on the chancellor and the prime minister ""to bury their differences"" and work together to bring down taxes and rein in public spending to fight inflation.  Writing in the Sunday Express, Rishi Sunak promises to do ""everything in his power"" to help people with the cost of living crisis.  A Tory backbencher tells the paper that Conservative MPs are expecting an ""emergency budget in all but name"". Ahead of Boris Johnson's trip to Northern Ireland with the aim of easing tensions over post-Brexit trade, the Sun on Sunday stresses that he remains at ""loggerheads"" with his Foreign Secretary Liz Truss.  The Sunday Times suggests there's ""ill-disguised fury"" in some parts of No 10 at Ms Truss' stance on relations with the EU.  In its analysis, the Observer suggests that there's growing evidence that Northern Ireland is starting to profit from the current trading arrangements, making calls to slash the protocol ""bogus"".  Sign up for a morning briefing direct to your inbox. Leaked government documents in The Observer warn that many school buildings in England are ""crumbling"" and ""pose a risk to life"". Officials in the Department for Education are reported to be demanding billions extra from the Treasury to help rebuild schools.  A government spokesperson said it had invested more than Â£11bn in the past seven years on improving school buildings. The former health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, calls in the Sunday Times for major surgery on what he calls a ""rogue system"" of cover-up culture in the NHS.  He insists it leads to avoidable deaths in England. In a new book, which is serialised in the paper, Mr Hunt said he was ""shocked to his core"" by failures in care.  According to the Sunday Mirror, hospital patients in England have been placed on mixed-sex wards on more than 13,000 occasions since last October - despite this being banned 12 years ago.  The Patients Association calls it ""an affront"" to people's dignity.  On its front page, the Sun reports that Christian Bruckner, who's a prime suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, had a face changing operation four months after she was reported missing.  The paper says his jaw was reset and his teeth straightened. The Sun suggests he will face charges later this year. The death of the former Australian international cricketer, Andrew Symonds, in a car crash is the main story in the Sydney Morning Herald.  Its online news site describes the cricket world as being in mourning in what it calls ""a devastating year"" for the sport after the deaths of Rod Marsh and Shane Warne. The former Australian captain, Mark Taylor, said Symonds ""hit the ball a long way and just wanted to entertain"". Liverpool's FA Cup victory is celebrated on many front pages. ""Their cups runneth over..."" says the Telegraph headline as the Reds lift their second trophy of the season.  The Mail on Sunday focuses on fans who booed Prince William ahead of the match, which has been condemned by MPs. The Eurovision Song Contest finished after the newspapers were printed. Online, the Daily Star suggests it was an ""emotional night"" for the Ukrainian winners, saying the Kalush Orchestra ""stole the hearts of half the globe"".  The Mail Online describes it as a ""wave of love"" from across Europe. The Times concludes that ""well, it just had to be Ukraine"", adding that it might have been a UK win ""in any other year"".

Burnley 2-0 Southampton: Clarets keep Premier League survival hopes alive,"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 21:03:29 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60717448,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60717448?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Burnley produce a fine performance to beat Southampton to give their hopes of Premier League survival a huge boost.," Last updated on 21 April 202221 April 2022.From the section Premier Leaguecomments681 Burnley produced one of their finest performances of the season to beat Southampton at Turf Moor and give their hopes of Premier League survival a huge boost. The Clarets earned their first win in the post-Sean Dyche era, and just their fifth in the league this season, to close to within one point of 17th-placed Everton with six games to play. Connor Roberts scored a timely first goal for the club when he curled a delightful opener into the far corner and Nathan Collins headed in to double their lead before half-time. With interim boss Mike Jackson in the dugout, the hosts delivered an impressive attacking display but also showed the grit associated with their decade under Dyche to keep any Saints revival at bay. It is a victory that sets up a tantalising relegation scrap heading into the run-in, as Burnley look to earn a seventh successive season in the top flight at the expense of the Toffees, or potentially even Leeds United. Burnley's hierarchy have taken a gamble in dismissing Dyche, a manager who guided them to two promotions and has experience of surviving in the top flight, but if the Clarets can reproduce this level of performance for the remainder of the season it may well be one that pays off.  They have played a game more than Everton, but are now just a point behind Frank Lampard's side and boast a better goal difference, while Leeds - currently five points above the drop zone - are also not completely safe.  If Burnley can now earn at least a point against Wolves at home on Sunday, Everton will head into the Merseyside derby against Liverpool at Anfield later that afternoon sitting inside the bottom three. There were no signs of tension in the Clarets camp as Roberts broke the deadlock after being given time to turn on the edge of the box and pick his spot with his left foot - a goal befitting Burnley's slick attacking performance. The hosts could and should have had more, but found Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster in top form as he denied Wout Weghorst with his feet and twice kept out Jay Rodriguez before Weghorst headed against the post.  Eventually Burnley's superiority told as Collins climbed highest in the box to meet Josh Brownhill's corner and nod it into the bottom corner, although celebrations were put on hold at an anxious Turf Moor as VAR watched to see if the ball had clipped the offside Jack Cork on its way in. Southampton, after beating Arsenal last time out, slipped back into their indifferent recent form with the visitors' best chances falling to Oriol Romeu, who headed wide of either post from James Ward-Prowse corners in the first half.  They did briefly threaten a response inside the final 20 minutes but Burnley goalkeeper Nick Pope saved from Che Adams and Charlie Taylor then made a superb block on the same player, while a scrambled Cork effort at the other end was ruled out for offside. The home fans showed their appreciation for the club's former boss by singing Dyche's name late on, as Burnley headed towards their first top-flight home win without him in the dugout since May 2010, and four points from a possible six since his departure.

Shortage of homes to rent leads to tenant bidding wars,"Sun, 05 Jun 2022 23:04:18 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61650382,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61650382?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Tenants are going to great lengths to secure a home from offering big deposits to sharing photos of their dogs.,"People hoping to find a property to rent are going to ever greater lengths to secure a home. As well as having to put up more cash in advance, they're offering landlords CVs for their children and photos of their well-behaved dogs. That's because a shortage of available homes is pushing up monthly rents, deposits and leading to bidding wars. Industry body Propertymark says the number of rentals on the books of lettings agencies has fallen sharply. Propertymark surveyed over 440 letting agency businesses, spread across 4,000 branches UK-wide and found that on average, letting agents have seen the number of available rentals on their books halve, from over 30 to just 15. One is agent Adam Kingswood, who says he's never known the market behave like this in two decades in the business.  ""We will list a property and stop taking viewings after just a few hours,"" he says. He lets properties in The Park area of Nottingham, where the wide leafy streets and Victorian houses make it one of the city's most popular property spots. ""Out of those who turn up, the majority will want the property and in most cases the landlord has a choice of what tenant they want to go with,"" he says. This leads to a sort of rental beauty pageant, with desperate renters vying to be chosen by landlords. Noisy pets and children can be seen as a downside, so some parents and owners are seeking to prove they're desirable tenants by providing photos or family bios. But it's money that does most of the talking.  ""Two years ago, I could count on one hand the amount of times a tenant would offer above the asking price for rent,"" says Mr Kingswood. Now people regularly offer three or even six months rent in advance or an extra Â£50 extra a month above the asking price, he said. Last month, the annual rental survey from website Rightmove found that asking rents are already at their highest ever level, and up 11% year-on-year to Â£1088 per month outside the capital.  The rocketing prices are making sitting tenants anxious. Teacher Sheree Osborne moved from London to Nottingham, to save money. She loves her new flat in a converted Art Deco hotel, but she's worried that when her lease is renewed in September, she'll end up in a bidding war.  ""I'm in a vulnerable position,"" she said. ""I don't want my landlord saying I have to move out because he wants to put the rent up Â£200. There are people willing to pay that.""  Propertymark says that landlords are selling up, unhappy with increased costs and red tape. Others are switching from renting to offering holiday lets. Lou Valdini for example, had a flat in London and two more in South Yorkshire which he rented out. He's now letting them all go. ""I feel disillusioned by the sector, it was something I enjoyed and wanted to keep doing,"" he says.  But during the pandemic one tenant stopped paying rent for sixteen months at the same time as behaving poorly towards fellow residents in the block. ""All that time I was paying the costs and mortgage, as well as getting complaints,"" Mr Valdini explains. It cost him around Â£20,000, he says.  ""The stress was huge. And I'm not a professional big company with people working for me to sort these things. It all fell on my shoulders."" Mick Roberts is another local landlord with more than thirty properties across Nottingham. His tenants are all on housing benefits, mostly families but many pensioners. Mr Roberts says he has ""a conscience"" about keeping rent down for his tenants. He has tenants so terrified their rent will go up they are too scared to ask for repairs, he says. Parents are sleeping on the sofa of one-bed apartments with three children in the bed because they can't find nor afford a bigger house to rent, he adds.  But while Mr Roberts is reluctant to raise rents for those already in his houses, he admits that he asks for the market rate from any new tenant. ""I've got no loyalty to that person,"" he says. ""As time goes on, we'll build up a rapport but for now it's supply and demand."" ""There's been something like 179 new rules in the last five years,"" he says. Which means costs are rising. ""You used to be able, rightly or wrongly, to give the tenants the keys and service the boiler once a year. Now we are part landlord, part policemen, counsellor, we do debt work like a bailiff."" Changes to taxation have made letting properties less profitable at the same time as legislation regarding maintenance and energy compliance has pushed up landlords' costs. The temporary ban on evictions during the pandemic left many landlords out of pocket, meaning an anticipated ban on ""Section 21"", which allows them to evict tenants easily, is causing concern they'll be left with limited power to protect their properties.  It may result in fewer landlords and more people homeless, Mr Roberts predicts. The Department for Levelling-Up, Communities and Housing said ""good landlords"" had nothing to fear from the reforms, which were designed to ""give tenants greater security to challenge unreasonable rent rises and poor practice"". ""We're supporting vulnerable renters to help them meet the rising cost of living and stay in their homes, as well as investing Â£11.5bn to build more of the affordable, quality homes this country needs - including tens of thousands for social rent,"" the spokesperson added.

"Bonn climate conference: Ukraine war no excuse for prolonging coal, Kerry warns","Sun, 05 Jun 2022 23:09:57 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-61659620,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-61659620?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"US climate envoy John Kerry warns the world is ""cooked"" if countries continue using coal.","The US envoy on climate change John Kerry has warned that the war in Ukraine must not be used as an excuse to prolong global reliance on coal.  Speaking to the BBC, Mr Kerry criticised a number of large countries for not living up to the promises they made at the COP26 climate summit. Climate diplomats meet again today in Bonn amid new, energy security worries. If countries extend their reliance on coal in response to the war, then ""we are cooked,"" Mr Kerry said.  The fragile unity shown in Glasgow last November is likely to be tested in Bonn as countries deal with the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the cost of living crisis. Mr Kerry told the BBC that despite these drawbacks, ""as a world we are still not moving fast enough,"" to rein in the emissions of warming gases that are driving up temperatures.  ""We can still win this battle,""  the former senator said, but it will require a ""wholesale elevation of effort by countries all around the world"". Mr Kerry's call was echoed by a leading Ukrainian scientist who urged delegates to speed up their transition away from fossil fuels.  Dr Svitana Krakovska said oil and gas were the ""enablers of war"". Today's meeting in Bonn, which will last until the end of next week, is much smaller than COP26 and is mainly a technical negotiation. It occurs halfway between the big conferences in Glasgow and COP27, to be held in Egypt. The talks will be carried out by civil servants with limited political input and will review progress on a host of issues agreed in the Glasgow Climate Pact, Bluntly, not a lot.  A BBC analysis shows that across a range of issues, very little has been achieved.  The world emerged from Glasgow into an energy crisis sparked by a rapid rise in the price of gas. This has been massively compounded by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and ongoing problems in global supply lines.  Prices for fossil energy have shot up dramatically as governments worry about security of supply.  Governments have also been slow in submitting new carbon cutting plans as they have promised to do by September.  The list of laggards includes some very significant countries such as India, and the hosts of COP27, Egypt. Despite this, there is a belief that political leaders still see climate as a major issue, especially in the light of dramatic heatwaves in India and Pakistan, which were linked to human use of fossil fuels.   The discussions in the former West German capital will tell us if that's true. ""I think we'll see the Bonn talks as a real test for whether political will is just words,"" said Alex Scott from environmental think tank, E3G.  ""Or whether there are real genuine commitments to make the changes in policy and in spending plans that are needed to address these issues."" Ukraine and Russia normally send delegates to this event, but it remains to be seen if both countries will participate.  This video can not be played ""Think about us,"" says Ukrainian climate scientist Dr Svitlana Krakovska, who led the Ukrainian delegation at the approval sessions of the recent IPCC reports, says climate isn't a critical issue right now.  But she hopes negotiators will recognise the role fossil fuels are playing in the war, and act with greater haste to transition away from them. ""The cause of this war, the enabler of this war is from oil and gas,"" she told BBC News. ""So this is the point for everybody to just think about this and use this opportunity to stop using so much energy and think about our way of life."" ""The global thing that has happened are these unprecedentedly high fossil fuel prices,"" said Lauri Myllyvirta from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.  ""That just means that clean energy is extremely competitive economically at the moment."" Some countries have indeed been increasing their coal production, such as India, where the government has decided to re-open more than 100 coal mines previously considered uneconomical.  But in the first quarter of 2022, India also added 3 gigawatts of solar power capacity.  That's roughly a fifth of the UK's entire solar installation, in just three months. In Europe, which has tabled plans for a swift move away from Russian energy, many countries are seeking alternative sources of fossil fuels ahead of an anticipated energy crunch this coming winter.  The worry for environmentalists is that some like Germany, are now spending money on long-term fossil infrastructure, such as the recently announced plans for new LNG terminals. This could prolong the use of natural gas and keep emissions high.  The most recent assessment indicates that China, the world's largest emitter, has seen the longest decline in carbon output in at least a decade.  A review of data carried out for Carbon Brief found emissions had fallen since last summer and were down 1.4% in the first quarter of 2022. This has happened because of last year's slowdown in the real estate market. It's continued because of the resurgence of Covid-19 and the re-introduction of lockdowns which have stemmed economic activity.  There are other changes taking effect in China - production of electric cars and trucks has doubled in a year to 20% of all new vehicles.  The number of wind turbines and solar farms coming on stream in the first four months of 2022 was up 100% on the record levels installed in 2021.  While coal production has ramped up, on balance, observers believe that China's emissions will fall this year, with implications for the rest of the world.  ""We could actually see less emissions this year because of increased prices for fossil fuels and because China's economy is in a tailspin,"" said Lauri Myllyvirta, who carried out the research.  By contrast the US, where President Biden has struggled to get climate legislation on the statute books, has seen another oil boom. According to analysis from Rystad Energy, flows of crude from the Permian basin are expected to grow by around 1 million barrels per day this year. The region in West Texas now has higher production than any country apart from Russia and Saudi Arabia.  To keep this key goal of the Paris climate agreement alive, carbon emissions need to be slashed essentially in half by 2030. But recent evidence from the UK Met Office indicates that there's now a fifty-fifty chance of temporarily going past the temperature threshold in the next five years. For many developing countries and small island states, an increase of 1.5C with knock on effects on sea levels poses existential questions. And they fear that the lack of political focus by richer nations on this core issue is increasing the threat.  ""Fundamentally, the war and cost of living must not be used as an excuse to let the 1.5C goal slip out of reach,"" said Ambassador Conrod Hunte, from Antigua and Barbuda, who's the lead negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States in the Bonn talks.  ""And adequate, fair climate finance is intrinsic to keeping us on this pathway."" Despite the many problems, participants believe there are some grounds for cautious optimism. This energy crisis has made discussions about heat pumps and electric vehicles part of the mainstream in a way the COPs have failed to do.   The success of climate-focussed candidates in Australia's recent election indicates that voters may be more attuned to voices who are connecting the global crises to rising temperatures.  The Bonn talks could also be a moment when addressing climate become key to dealing with these other challenges as well. ""There are a number of interlinking crises right now, and it is possible for governments to seize this opening to tackle these crises, and take advantage of the opportunities, and build the kind of co-operation globally that's needed,"" said David Waskow, from the World Resources Institute.

"Energy crisis pushing people onto prepayment meters, says Uswitch","Mon, 24 Oct 2022 23:02:45 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-63378460,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-63378460?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Uswitch says prepayment meter users are more likely to be vulnerable and at risk of running out of credit.,"The energy crisis is pushing more households onto prepayment gas and electricity meters, research suggests. Comparison website Uswitch said 60,000 new meters were installed in Britain in the six months to March, reversing a long-term trend of the number falling. It says prepayment customers are more likely to be vulnerable and at risk of being, in effect, disconnected when they cannot afford to top up. Ministers promised to focus energy support on the most vulnerable in 2023. Most UK households pay their gas and electricity bills by direct debit, typically receiving quarterly bills.  But using data from energy regulator Ofgem, Uswitch found that almost 7.4 million prepayment meters - either for gas or electricity - had been installed in Britain by March, up from over 7.3 million in October last year.  Uswitch said suppliers may put customers on prepayment meters if they struggle to keep up with bills, because it helps them control how much and how often they pay for energy. But it also said prepayment customers could choose to ""self-disconnect"" when costs got too high and faced higher standing charges for electricity. They are also unable to smooth bill rises over the year. Based on current trends, Uswitch says around 10,000 prepayment meters will be installed a month this winter, leaving thousands more households at risk. Richard Neudegg, director of regulation at the site, said the ""worrying"" trend followed more than two years in which the number of meters fell. ""With energy prices set to rise again in April, this is a warning of things to come and we will most likely see more and more households moved to prepayment meters in the coming months and years,"" he said.  ""Families and individuals on prepayment meters will be plunged into darkness as they self-disconnect when they can't afford to top up."" This research from Uswitch comes a week after the organisation End Fuel Poverty Coalition called on the government to temporarily block households from being moved onto prepayment meters.  While occasionally people may opt to be transferred to a prepayment box, for most households it's not a choice as a meter is often installed as part of a plan to repay debt owed to energy suppliers. It's those who are already in financial hardship who find themselves transferred to a system which is more expensive to run and has the risk of households being totally without heat and energy when credit runs out.  The anti-poverty collective, which includes Asthma + Lung UK, want the government to immediately suspend all forced transfers of households onto more prepayment meters, whether by court warrant or remotely via smart meters.  The current rules state that prepayment meters can only be installed if it is ""safe and reasonably practicable"" to do so. The End Fuel Poverty Coalition believes it's not possible that any enforced installation could meet those conditions this winter so the government should make sure energy companies are sticking to the rules. Gas and electricity prices have soared this year, largely as a result of the war in Ukraine.  The government has limited energy bills and prepayment meter costs until next April, meaning the typical household is paying about Â£2,500 a year.  Without that intervention, that annual bill would have been Â£3,549 a year. Last winter it was Â£1,277 a year. New Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has said the government will scale back its support after April 2023 while protecting the most vulnerable.

Uswitch is urging the government to prioritise those on pre-payment meters next year.  The Department for Business said the government's Energy Price Guarantee would reduce bills this winter by ""roughly a third"" of what they otherwise would have been.

Japan's female bosses mapping a course for other women,"Sun, 04 Sep 2022 23:02:57 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62719779,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62719779?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Female bosses remain a small minority in Japan, but efforts continue to increase their numbers.","Believed to have started in 869AD, the Gion Matsuri is one of the most famous annual festivals in Japan. This year it embraced the digital world. For the 2022 event back in July, an interactive, online map was made available to show where and when to see the 34 huge, ornate floats that paraded across the city of Kyoto over two separate days. Using GPS, it showed the location of each float. And you could also use the map to find your friends and chat with them. In addition, if you clicked on a building or street, you could read about its history in Japanese or English. The person behind the technology is Machi Takahashi, the president and co-chief executive of Kyoto-based, digital map firm Stroly. A mother of two, she is a rare female entrepreneur in a country where the start-up scene is still very much dominated by men. ""I was surprised that [the festival organisers] would let us digitise their map, because I thought these traditional cultural festivals are quite conservative,"" she says. The website-based digital map is accessed by scanning a QR code. Hideo Yoshii, who is in charge of looking after one of the biggest floats, says that Stroly may have gotten some pushback if it had just wanted to put QR code stickers or signs up on walls. Instead Stroly created a pretty postcard that had not just the QR code printed on it, but also the pattern of a traditional Japanese map. This complemented the atmosphere of the ancient event, and was also used as the design for the digital map Stroly made. ""Before the pandemic, we gave out a pamphlet, but tourists found it difficult to navigate the city,"" says a spokeswoman for the city's tourism department. ""By using Stroly's digital map, police officers who are on the ground found it much easier to explain to visitors where to go. We've also managed to reduce our paper waste by a third,"" she adds.  The idea to set up a business making digital maps came to Ms Takahashi and her husband and co-founder Toru while they were both still working at Kyoto-based technology research institute ATR. He is Stroly's chairman and co-chief executive.  One of their first customers was the movie industry theme park Toei Kyoto Studio Park back in 2010. ""We asked Mr and Ms Takahashi to create a game using Nintendo DS,"" says Norihiro Yamaguchi, who was the boss of Toei Kyoto Studio Park at the time. New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. The map and GPS-based game that the Takahashis produced involved the park's visitors having to locate seven actors playing screen villains. Six years later, the Takahashis left the research institute to set up Stroly as their own business, with the theme park remaining one of its main clients.  ""Thanks to smartphones which allow users to access the Stroly map in different languages, visitors can find out about the details of our shows and facilities,"" says a spokesman for the park. Stroly has now produced almost 10,000 interactive, digital maps, including one highlighting the vibrant nightlife of the busy Shinjuku area of central Tokyo. That was commissioned by the government of the capital city. Other maps include where to find the best cheese in the Tokachi dairy farming region of Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost main island, as well as work for clients outside Japan. For members of the public Stroly's maps are free to use. It instead makes its money by charging its customers, mostly in tourism and transport, annual subscriptions. ""When I started thinking about starting my own business in 2015, there was no woman in this information technology field so I had to find my way into this community,"" says Ms Takahashi. ""I had to actually contact [US-based Japanese entrepreneur] Ari Horie from Women's Startup Lab in Silicon Valley, instead of [anyone] in Japan, to help me out."" Stroly was subsequently selected as one of the first start-ups to be given mentoring by a new regional business support agency called Osaka Innovation Hub. This was where Ms Takahashi managed to secure funding from Japanese investment bank Daiwa Securities. The firm also later received money from Kyoto City's start-up fund. The difficulty faced by female entrepreneurs is not unique to Japan. Even in the US, only 2% of venture capital, which invests in new start-ups, went to women last year. In an article for Vogue magazine last month where she announced that she was ""evolving away from tennis"", US sports star Serena Williams said this was part of the reason she launched her own investment fund, Serena Ventures. ""Sometimes like attracts like,"" wrote Williams. ""Men are writing those big cheques to one another, and in order for us to change that, more people who look like me need to be in that position, giving money back to themselves."" Ms Takahashi agrees. ""The decision-making roles are also mostly [held by] men. I think they simply cannot relate to the problems and issues addressed by women entrepreneurs,"" she says. The Japanese government had wanted to use the five years from 2015 to 2020 to almost triple the proportion of female managers in the country to reach 30% of the total. However, the current level is just 15%, compared with the global average of 31%. And according to the country's Financial Services Agency, less than 1% of Japanese venture capital firms are run by women. Kathy Matsui leads one such firm, MPower Partners, which she recently started in Tokyo with two female partners, Yumiko Murakami and Seki Miwa. A former vice chair of investment bank Goldman Sachs Japan, Ms Matsui is best known for her ""womenomics"" drive since the 1990s, which has encouraged the Japanese government to improve its gender ratio among businesses.  ""I would say the vast majority of entrepreneurs and founders we've met so far, here in Japan, are male,"" she says. ""But when we think about start-ups, they're trying to use innovation to create disruptive businesses, life-changing technologies. And if you're excluding half the population from your potential talent pool as a start-up, you're already trying to win a marathon on one leg rather than two."" Back in Kyoto, Ms Takahashi's success in finding a gap in the digital tourism market may be an exception to the male-dominated rule. There is no denying that it is still an uphill battle to create a greater equal footing in Japan's workforce. So does she have any advice for younger entrepreneurs, and particularly female ones?  ""Jump into the ecosystem,"" she says. ""It is very easy to get to know someone in the field, and once you know somebody, it's a great network that you need to expand your business.""

Joshua was defeated by split decision in the heavyweight world title rematch. After the contest, the Briton picked up two of Usyk's belts, dropped them out of the ring and strode towards the dressing room, before returning to the ring to give an impassioned speech. ""I let myself down,"" Joshua tweeted. After returning to the ring, the 32-year-old confronted Usyk, saying, ""you're not strong, how did you beat me? How? I had character and determination'.

In his tweets on Sunday, external, he wished Usyk, who also beat him on points last September in London, ""continued success in your quest for greatness"".  ""You are a class act, champ,"" he said. ""Yesterday I had to mentally take myself into a dark place to compete for the championship belts! I had two fights, one with Usyk and one with my emotions and both got the better of me. ""I'll be the first to admit, I let myself down. I acted out of pure passion and emotion and when not controlled it ain't great. I love this sport so so much and I'll be better from this point on.

Revealed: Huge gas flaring emissions never reported,"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 00:58:11 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-62917498,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-62917498?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,BBC investigation finds oil companies not declaring millions of tonnes of cancer-linked emissions.,"Major oil companies are not declaring a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, a BBC News investigation has revealed. The BBC found millions of tonnes of undeclared emissions from gas flaring at oil fields where BP, Eni, ExxonMobil, Chevron and Shell work. Flaring of natural gas is the ""wasteful"" burning of excess gas released during oil production. The companies said their reporting method was standard industry practice. Flared gases emit a potent mix of carbon dioxide, methane and black soot which pollute the air and accelerate global warming. The BBC has also found high levels of potentially cancer-causing chemicals in Iraqi communities near oil fields where there is gas flaring. These fields have some of the highest levels of undeclared flaring in the world, according to our findings.  In response, David Boyd, UN special rapporteur on human rights and the environment, compared these communities to ""modern sacrifice zones, areas where profit and private interests are prioritised over human health, human rights and the environment"". Under Poisoned Skies The deadly impact of the oil giants' toxic air pollution on children and the planet is revealed in this BBC News Arabic investigation from the front line of climate change in Iraq. The documentary is available to watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK only) and is also being broadcast on BBC World News at 08:10 GMT on Saturday 1 October. Companies have long recognised the need to eliminate all but emergency flaring. BP, Eni, ExxonMobil, Chevron and Shell are committed to a 2015 World Bank pledge to declare and end routine flaring by 2030 - in Shell's case by 2025. But the companies say that where they have contracted with another company to run day-to-day operations, it is that other firm's responsibility to declare flaring emissions.  Such fields are a major part of oil production - accounting for 50% of these five companies' portfolios, on average. However, through months of analysis the BBC found dozens of oil fields where these operators are not declaring the emissions either, meaning no-one is. Using World Bank flare-tracking satellite data, we were able to identify the emissions from each of these sites. We estimate that in 2021, almost 20 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent went unreported from these flares. That is equal to the greenhouse gas emissions 4.4 million cars would produce in a year. In response, all five firms said that the approach to reporting emissions only from the sites they directly operate was standard industry practice.  Shell and Eni additionally said that they do give an overall emissions figure which includes flaring from non-operated sites, but said this is not broken down or included in their World Bank pledge to cut emissions.   A BBC News Arabic investigation indicates that flaring increases the risk of some cancers for people living near oil fields in Iraq. People living in some of the world's biggest oil fields in Basra, south-east Iraq - Rumaila, West Qurna, Zubair and Nahran Omar - have long suspected that childhood leukaemia is on the increase, and that flaring is behind it.  In the Basra region, new cases of all types of cancer rose by 20% between 2015 and 2018, according to a leaked Iraq Health Ministry report seen by BBC News Arabic. It blames air pollution.  BP and Eni are the lead contractors at Rumaila and Zubair oil fields respectively, but as they are not the operators they do not declare the emissions. Neither do the sites' operators.  BBC News Arabic worked with environment and health experts near the four sites in 2021 to test for cancer-causing chemicals associated with flaring over two weeks.   The air tests indicated levels of benzene, linked to leukaemia and other blood disorders, reached or exceeded Iraq's national limit in at least four places.  Urine samples we collected from 52 children indicated that 70% had elevated levels of 2-Naphthol, a form of the possibly cancer-causing substance naphthalene.  Dr Manuela Orjuela-Grimm, professor of childhood cancer at Columbia University, said: ""The children have strikingly high levels â¦ this is concerning for [their] health and suggests they should be monitored closely.""  When she was 11, Fatima Falah Najem was diagnosed with a type of blood and bone cancer called acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Exposure to benzene can increase the risk of people developing this condition.  Fatima lived with her parents and six siblings near Zubair oil field, where Eni is the lead contractor.  Neither Eni nor Zubair's operating company declare flaring emissions there.  For health reasons, Iraqi law prohibits flaring within six miles (10 km) of people's homes.  But the flares in Zubair blaze almost continuously, just 1.6 miles from the family's front door.  Fatima drew the ""fiery flames"" that surrounded her home, during her chemotherapy treatment.  She told us she enjoyed watching them at night, and came to normalise them. But for her father, watching her get sick was ""like being on fire without being able to extinguish it"". Fatima died last November as her family desperately sought a bone marrow transplant. She was 13. Asked for a response, Eni said it ""strongly rejects any allegation that its own activities are endangering the health of the Iraqi people"".  Eni said that it does not contractually have responsibility for flaring in Zubair. Rumaila oil field, 25 miles away, flares more gas than any other site in the world, according to BBC calculations - enough to power nearly three million UK homes a year. BP is the lead contractor - it helped establish and now supervises the operator, Rumaila Operating Organisation (ROO). Neither declares any flaring from the oil field.  ROO's operating standards, which BP signed, say: ""Those who are impacted by pollution levels that exceed national limits are legally entitled to compensation.""  But Ali Hussein Julood, a 19-year-old leukaemia survivor, says that he and his father were met with silence when they sought compensation from BP in 2020 and 2021. BP said: ""We are extremely concerned by the issues raised by the BBC - we will immediately review those concerns.""  On the leaked report on cancer in the Basra area, Iraq's Oil Minister Ihsan Abdul Jabbar Ismail told us: ""We instructed all the contracted companies operating in the oil fields to uphold international standards.""  If all the natural gas flared globally were captured and used it could replace more than nine-tenths of Europe's gas imports from Russia, based on figures from the International Energy Agency. Capturing the gas can be initially expensive and technically difficult, according to the World Bank. It estimates that ending all routine flaring could cost as much as $100bn (Â£92bn). But Mark Davis, chief executive of Capterio, which advises oil companies on capturing flared gas, told the BBC that countries like Norway have shown it is possible with the help of strong regulation.

""All work and no PlayStations help girls beat boys,"" it says.  The paper focuses on comments from an education expert who says the gender gap widened during the pandemic because girls were less likely to abandon their studies and escape to video games.  The Telegraph predicts there will be a ""record"" fall in top GCSE grades, with 75,000 fewer pupils than last year likely to get the equivalent of As or A*s.  It says this is due to the exams watchdog being asked to rein in the number of top grades awarded after they reached an all-time high last year, during the pandemic. It says some schools have arranged additional pastoral support, including mental health first-aiders and careers advisers.  The lead for the Telegraph is the pressure on the NHS 111 helpline.  It says patients calling the line are being left on hold much longer than the expected response time of 20 seconds, with calls now being answered, on average, after six and a half minutes. It says some patients have complained of being left on hold for up to an hour. The Guardian reports on what it says is the worsening staffing crisis in care homes. It says severe staff shortages in previously good homes are pushing operators to break rules and put residents at risk.  The paper reports that some people are being left in their rooms 24 hours a day and denied showers for more than a week.  The i paper saysa poll has revealed that more than 1.7 million households are considering or have already cancelled direct debits to energy suppliers this autumn.  It comes as bills are expected to rise to Â£3,500, the paper adds, with energy firms urged not to chase those who cannot pay.   The Daily Express is interested in a proposal from the National Grid to give rebates to consumers who avoid using energy during peak times.  It says people with smart meters will be encouraged to turn off power-hungry appliances such as washing machines, tumble driers and computer games consoles. In its leader column, the paper encourages its readers to join ""the great turn off"".  Sign up for a morning briefing direct to your inbox. The Financial Times leads on comments from a senior Russian diplomat that Moscow expects a long conflict in Ukraine.  Gennady Gatilov, Russia's representative to the UN in Geneva, says he can see no possibility of a diplomatic solution or direct talks between Vladimir Putin and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky.  The front page of the Daily Mail highlights a blood test for the over-50s which the paper says could prevent as many as one in 10 cancer deaths. The paper calls it the ""holy grail"" test and says researchers are optimistic it has ""enormous potential"".  The lead story in the Times is a suggestion that Conservative voters have ""sellers' remorse"" over the ousting of Boris Johnson and would prefer him over the two leadership contenders.  It says interviews with floating voters in marginal constituencies found little enthusiasm for either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak as prime minister.  Finally, both the Sun and the Mirror lead on the fatal stabbing of Tyson Fury's cousin. Rico Burton, who was 31, died outside a bar at Altrincham in Greater Manchester.

Village head and family killed by Russia - Ukraine,"Mon, 04 Apr 2022 20:00:48 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60989632,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60989632?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The BBC sees further evidence of alleged atrocities in areas recently occupied by Russia.,"Russian forces have killed a village head, her husband and her son, Ukrainian officials say. This - and the discovery of the bodies of five men dressed in civilian clothes - has added to growing evidence of atrocities on the ground in Ukraine. The BBC's Yogita Limaye has been to visit the two scenes.  In the town of Bucha, just outside Kyiv, the horror of what unfolded during the Russian occupation is finally coming to light.  In the basement of a building that once housed a children's community centre, five bodies lay crumpled on the ground - five men dressed in civilian clothes, their hands bound behind their backs.  Some were shot in the head, others in the chest. They were yet to be identified, but Ukrainian officials said the men were taken hostage by Russian soldiers and executed.  ""We heard them being shot,"" said Vlad, one of the volunteers who carried the bodies up from the basement. ""We heard mines go off in the area. Around us there are mines. We are lucky we are alive."" Vlad described hearing a husband calling after his wife who went out into the street to get water, then a volley of shots. Later he found both husband and wife dead. ""I can tell you so many stories but I don't want to,"" he said. ""I want to forget them."" Not far away, in the village of Motoyzhyn, four bodies lay in a shallow grave in the woods. Three have been identified - 51-year-old Olha Sukhenko, her husband Igor and her son Oleksander, who was 25. Olha was the head of the village. It is believed that she and her family were killed on suspicion of helping Ukrainian soldiers, and left on the edge of the woods, half-buried, Olha's hand and her son's face visible through the dirt.  The Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky visited Bucha on Monday. ""We want you to show the world what happened here, what the Russian military did, what the Russian Federation did in peaceful Ukraine. It was important for you to see that these were civilians,"" he said. He said Ukraine was still prepared to negotiate with Russia. ""Ukraine deserves peace,"" he told the BBC. ""We can't live with war. Every day our army is fighting, but we don't want the lives of millions to be lost. That's why we have to have dialogue with Russia."" This video can not be played Watch: Ukraine's president visits the site of alleged atrocities in Bucha Elsewhere in Bucha, there were reports of a mass grave, dug to accommodate bodies from the overflowing morgue. Images and video footage showed dead civilians with their hands tied behind their backs. Evidence was mounting by the hour on Monday of grave atrocities in this once peaceful city.  The mayor, Anatoliy Fedoruk, said that at least 300 civilians had been killed. There is no official tally yet. Russia has denied any involvement, claiming that the visual evidence had all been faked, but its denials have been met with outrage. Its broken-down, burned-out tanks littered one long road into Bucha. We now know some of what happened here, just west of Kyiv. But there are more cities and towns across Ukraine that are still under Russian control. The fear is that what was found here will be found elsewhere, that there will be more bodies in basements and shallow graves.

British Virgin Islands: UK decides against direct rule of territory,"Wed, 08 Jun 2022 15:19:47 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-61736373,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-61736373?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,A new administration will be able to make reforms after a report found gross failures of governance.,"The UK has decided not to impose direct rule on the British Virgin Islands, despite a report finding gross failures of governance in the territory. The review said the BVI's constitution should be suspended and its government dissolved amid corruption concerns. But the foreign secretary will instead allow a new administration to implement reforms in the next two years.  If they fail to meet targets, Liz Truss has taken new powers to make imposing direct rule easier. The former leader of the BVI, Andrew Fahie, was arrested in April for alleged drug smuggling and money laundering in the US. The inquiry was commissioned in 2021 amid claims about corruption and misuse of taxpayers' money but was not directly connected to the arrest of Mr Fahie. Led by British judge Sir Gary Hickinbottom, the report described the state of governance in the BVI as ""appallingly bad"". He found that millions of dollars of state funds were spent each year by politicians and ministries without proper process, there was ""serious dishonesty"" relating to sales of public property, and there was widespread abuse of appointments. In his conclusions, Sir Gary called for a two-year suspension of the BVI constitution, cessation of the elected ministerial government and the imposition of direct rule by the UK. He also recommended reviews of the government's welfare payments, the sale of public land, and law enforcement on the islands.  Outlining her reasons for not imposing direct rule on the BVI, Ms Truss pointed to changes that have been made since Sir Gary's report in April, including the removal of Mr Fahie from his role and the creation of a new government of national unity, which has begun criminal investigations.  Ms Truss said she believed the BVI's new government should be given the opportunity to ""demonstrate their commitment to reform"" and implement the 48 recommendations made by Sir Gary and the further measures the administration has proposed.  But she added: ""If it becomes clear that this approach is not delivering the reform the people of the BVI want and deserve we will take action. This may require the swift implementation of the final report recommendation [imposing direct rule]."" In May, Mr Fahie pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiring to launder money and import cocaine to the United States, according to Reuters news agency.

A bomb hit this theatre hiding hundreds - here's how one woman survived,"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 20:09:20 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60835106,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60835106?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"The BBC speaks to survivors of the Mariupol theatre attack, who describe for the first time what happened.","As the port city of Mariupol was being razed to rubble by Russian bombs, hundreds of civilians, mostly women and children, went to hide in a theatre near the waterfront, a grand Soviet-era building. Last Wednesday, a bomb hit and - within seconds - the building had been split in two and left in ruins. We still do not know how many died, but the BBC has spoken to survivors who described for the first time what happened when the bomb fell.  All morning, Russian planes had been circling the skies above the city.  Mariia Rodionova, a 27-year-old teacher, had been living in the theatre for 10 days, having fled her ninth-floor apartment with her two dogs. They camped next to the stage in an auditorium near the back of the building. That morning she had got some fish scraps from an outdoor field kitchen to feed her dogs, but then realised they had not drunk any water. So at about 10:00, she tied her dogs to her luggage and made her way towards the main entrance where a queue was forming for hot water. And then the bomb fell.  There was the sound of a clap, thunderous and loud. Then the sound of broken glass. A man came from behind and pushed her to a wall, protecting her with his own body. The blast was so loud that she felt intense pain in one of her ears, so intense she thought her eardrum must have split. She only realised it had not because she could hear the screams of people. The screams were everywhere. The force of the blast threw another man against a window. He fell on the ground, his face covered with broken glass. A woman, who also had a wound on her head, tried to help him. Mariia, who had been volunteering at the Ukrainian Red Cross in Mariupol, gathered her senses enough to shout over, telling her to stop. ""I said 'Wait, don't touch him. I'll bring my first aid kit and I'll help you both',"" she recalled. But her kit was inside the theatre, and that part of the building had collapsed.  ""There was only rubble,"" she said. It was impossible for her to get in. ""For two hours, I couldn't do anything,"" she said. ""I just stayed there. I was in shock.""  Vladyslav, a 27-year-old locksmith who does not want to use his full name, had also wandered into the building that morning. He had some friends there and went to look for them. He was near the main entrance when the explosion hit. He ran with others into a basement and, 10 minutes later, heard the building was on fire and emerged to a scene of chaos.   ""Terrible things were happening,"" he said.    He saw plenty of people bleeding. Some had open fracture wounds. ""One mother was trying to find her kids under the rubble. A five-year-old kid was screaming: 'I don't want to die'. It was heartbreaking."" It is likely to have been just one bomb that fell on the theatre that morning, bringing all that destruction with it, analysis by McKenzie Intelligence Services for the BBC has concluded. ""Due to the missile appearing to accurately hit the centre of the building, we believe it is a laser-guided bomb, likely the KAB-500L or similar variant, launched from an aircraft,"" the London-based group said.  ""The nature of the explosion indicates it was armed with an instantaneous fuse, so was unable to penetrate the ground floors."" From the accuracy of the strike it is very likely that the theatre was the chosen target.  Satellite imagery released by the US company Maxar, from the days before the attack, show the word ""children"" in Russian was clearly painted on the lawn in front of the theatre, visible to any passing bomber.  Russia denies attacking the theatre. It has also denied hitting civilian sites in Ukraine, although its attacks on countless residential buildings and other non-military facilities have been well documented across the country and nowhere more brutally than in Mariupol.  Andrei Marusov, an investigative journalist from Mariupol, had visited the theatre two days before the attack. ""Everybody knew that it was a focal point for many women and children,"" Marusov, who is a former chairman of the advocacy group Transparency International Ukraine, said. ""There were only civilians there."" That Wednesday, the day of the bombing, he had gone up to the top of his building at 06:00 to survey the city. The planes were still buzzing through the air. He said Russian planes had been shelling and bombarding the area where the theatre was, that Sea of Azov waterfront all morning.  ""I saw that the city centre was covered by fire and constant explosions,"" he said. Mariia also remembers military planes ""making circles"" near the theatre that morning, and ""throwing bombs somewhere else"". But it was not unusual for her to spot military planes flying in the area. She had got used to their sound.   There are still many details that remain unclear about the attack. It is thought that up to 1,000 people were sheltering in the drama theatre. Some appeared to have based themselves in its underground bunker or bomb shelter, according to others who hid in the building and city authorities. Mariia saw others living in crowded corridors on overground floors. One thing which is clear from the accounts of the people the BBC spoke to, is that people would wander around the complex, its corridors and grounds, and others would come and go.  The day after the attack, the city council said 130 people had been rescued. A further update said it was possible that many had survived. But there has been no news since then. The city is in such a desperate state that there may never be a clear picture of how many were there and how many survived.  Mariia's home inside the theatre for the days she was there was in an auditorium hall with a chandelier, and she nestled right next to the stage because her dogs had drawn some complaints. She said there were about 30 people in that hall and it is her belief that they must have all perished when the bomb hit. It was sheer luck that she had stepped outside at that moment.  After the blasts she was unable to find her dogs and it was a moment of desperation: ""For me,"" she said, ""my dogs were more important than anything.""  Vladyslav said he saw many people coming out of the building, something that Mariia saw as well.   ""Some were with their luggage,"" she said. ""No-one knew what to do, and the area was still being shelled.""  Standing outside the theatre, she too looked at the damage. She realised it made no sense to look for another shelter. It had been a few stunned hours and she eventually left.  She tried to stop any car leaving the city. ""People were in panic,"" she said, ""no-one took me in their car."" She started to walk along the coast. ""I needed to get out of the city.""  First, she got to the village of Pishchanka. ""I met a woman,"" she said, ""who asked if I was OK. I started to cry."" She was offered tea and food, and invited to spend the night. The next morning, she kept walking, until she reached Melekyne. A curfew meant she had to stop at 20:00. A day later, she walked to Yalta. The following one, to Berdyansk. ""I walked all that time,"" she said.  Mariupol has seen the worst horrors of Russia's aggression on Ukraine. The invading troops have surrounded the city and attacked it relentlessly for almost a month, from the air, land and, in recent days, also from the sea. About 100,000 people remain trapped, subjected to a medieval-like siege. No electricity, no gas, no running water. When Mariia left her flat for the theatre, her grandmother, who lived with her, refused to go. ""She just said: 'It's my apartment, my home. I'm going to die here'.""  Mariia is still waiting to hear whether she is alive. Â© 2024 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking."
The Hundred: 'Phenomenal' Laura Wolvaardt guides Superchargers to record win over Originals,"Sun, 21 Aug 2022 20:17:55 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/62627622,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/62627622?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"South Africa's Laura Wolvaardt makes a masterful, unbeaten 90 as Northern Superchargers complete a record chase in the Women's Hundred against Manchester Originals."," Last updated on 21 August 202221 August 2022.From the section The Hundred ""A special innings in any format"". ""A phenomenal innings"".  That was how BBC commentator Kevin Howells and summariser Lauren Winfield-Hill described Laura's Wolvaardt's masterful, unbeaten 90 off 49 balls as Northern Superchargers chased a Women's Hundred record 161 to beat Manchester Originals on Sunday. ""There was elegance, brutality, skill and nerve in that innings to see Superchargers over the line,"" added Howells.  He wasn't wrong. The South Africa international, 23, perfectly timed her innings and struck 13 fours and two sixes as Superchargers got over the line with one ball to spare.  Her side were always behind the eight-ball, needing 89 from 50 balls and 35 from the final 15, but Wolvaardt turned the game on its head. Four, four, six, four off Lea Tahuhu and suddenly the hosts were the favourites. They still needed 11 off the final five balls after a tight set from Kate Cross, but the pressure told on the Originals. Deandra Dottin, who had earlier smashed a sensational 68 off 30 balls, including five sixes, started with a no-ball, before fumbling and passing up a clear run-out opportunity. It was enough to leave the former West Indies international in tears in the dugout post game as she now prepares to return home for a new 60-ball competition.  On the other hand, Wolvaardt strolled off with a beaming smile on her face as a sun-soaked Headingley stood and applauded a new hero.  ""I feel like the games before this I tried to whack it just way too hard,"" Wolvaardt told Sky Sports. ""I lost my shape early on but I knew I had a bit more time now with opening and that I just needed to pierce the gaps in the powerplay and I just went with that until the end.""  Speaking to BBC Sport, she added: ""When we needed 50 off 20 I knew it would be really tough to win it from there so I knew I had to swing from the hip a little bit and I'm glad it came off."" Wolvaardt has been a name on many lips this summer after some eye-catching innings for South Africa against England, but there was debate about whether she was wasted in the middle order in the T20 series as England dominated. It is a topic Wolvaardt is comfortable discussing, saying she ""struggled"" at the top of the order at the start of her international career,  The 23-year-old averages 17.19 there in international T20s, but that rises to 29 at three and 41 at four.  She was promoted to the top of the order for this game, with India's Jemimah Rodrigues missing through injury, and the inevitable questions about whether it could be a permanent change were asked. ""I don't know anymore,"" said Wolvaardt. ""Today might change my mind a little bit. ""The first couple of balls of my innings are pretty crucial - if I get off to a decent start then I do enjoy opening but you can get bogged down in the powerplay so it is just about finding that balance."" One thing is certain, as Winfield-Hill said: ""If you've come today, you've got your money's worth."" ""And they will be back for more, that's the main thing,"" replied Howells.   That's what The Hundred is all about; people wanting to come back for more.

Culture Secretary says elite women's events should be 'reserved for people born of female sex',"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 21:56:33 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/61973789,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/61973789?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries tells the heads of UK sporting bodies that elite women's sport ""must be reserved for people born of female sex""."," Last updated on 28 June 202228 June 2022.From the section Sport Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries has told the heads of UK sporting bodies that ""elite and competitive women's sport must be reserved for people born of the female sex"". Dorries met representatives from 15 sports including football, cricket, rugby, tennis and athletics plus UK Sport and Sport England bosses. Swimming's world governing body Fina recently voted to stop transgender athletes from competing in women's elite events if they have gone through any part of the male puberty process. Britain's Olympic diving champion Tom Daley has said he is ""furious"" at Fina's decision. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in April he did not believe transgender women should compete in female sporting events. Dorries urged the governing bodies ""to adopt the government's unequivocal view"" on transgender athletes competing in women's sports. She said that ""clear direction is needed that protects and shows compassion to all athletes"" and encouraged them to move to a position ""where fairness takes priority in competitive sport"", which included considering ""launching inclusive open categories where appropriate"". Fina says it is aiming to establish an 'open' category at competitions for swimmers whose gender identity is different than their birth sex. ""Sport is for everyone, no matter where you've come from in life. It allows people to come together and perform on a level playing field, based upon basic fairness and the integrity of competition,"" said Dorries. ""The government has the utmost compassion for people born into a body they don't recognise. But we can't pretend that sex doesn't have a direct impact on a person's athletic performance. Asking women and teenage girls to compete against someone who was biologically born a male is inherently unfair. ""I recognise that this is a complex and emotionally charged issue, so I welcome the support of our domestic governing bodies to protect and show compassion to all athletes. In the interests of sporting integrity, we must bring clarity to protect the future interests of sport around the world.""  For their part, the governing bodies said that they are ""actively carrying out their own scientific research to establish the impact of athletes' sex at birth and gender reassignment on athletic performance"".  UK Sport and UK England will report back to ministers on progress later in the summer. Fina took the decision after a report by a scientific panel said that going through male puberty meant trans women retained a ""relative performance advantage over biological females"", even after medication to reduce testosterone. Former Great Britain swimmer Sharron Davies, who has argued against transgender participation in women's elite swimming, told BBC Sport she was ""really proud of Fina"". However, 'Athlete Ally' - an LGBT advocacy group which organised a letter of support for transgender American college swimmer Lia Thomas in February, called the new policy ""discriminatory, harmful, unscientific and not in line with the 2021 IOC principles"". Cycling's governing body, the UCI, recently toughened its rules on transgender eligibility. In rugby league, transgender players have been banned from women's internationals while International Rugby League does further research on its policy. Other world governing bodies, including World Athletics and Fifa, are now reviewing their inclusion policies. World Athletics president Lord Coe hinted to the BBC that the sport could follow swimming's example, saying it is set to discuss adopting a new eligibility policy and that ""fairness is non-negotiable"".

The Nigerians worried about a bill to outlaw cross-dressing,"Wed, 03 Aug 2022 00:56:15 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-61646540,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-61646540?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,LGBTQ+ Nigerians fear what might happen if a proposal to ban cross-dressing is adopted by parliament.,"Trans women and men and non-binary people in Nigeria are nervously eyeing a parliamentary proposal that seeks to criminalise cross-dressing. It aims to amend the Same-Sex Marriage (Prohibition) Act (SSMPA) and defines cross-dressing as the ""practice of wearing clothes usually worn by a person of the opposite sex"".  Anyone found guilty could end up with a six-month prison sentence or a fine of $1,200 (Â£980).  It may not make it to the statute books, but it has highlighted the oppression that the LGBTQ+ community in Nigeria has felt for years.   In 2014, then-President Goodluck Jonathan signed the SSMPA into law. It forbids same-sex partners living together or any ""public show of same-sex amorous relationship"" among other measures, which essentially criminalises Nigeria's gay community. When the SSMPA was discussed nearly a decade ago, the lawmakers said they were simply reflecting the prevailing values of Nigerian society. ""We are protecting humanity and family values. In fact, we are protecting civilisation in its entirety,"" one of the backers of the law, Senator Ahmed Lawan, said at the time.  But trans woman and designer Fola Francis, 28, says the proposed amendment ""honestly scares me"". ""The cross-dressing bill is a very dangerous bill that is going to affect so many trans and non-binary people.""  Even in the current climate, without any new law, she said she had not been able to live in her apartment for several months ""because I got death threats from my neighbours due to them finding out I'm a trans woman on social media when my videos went viral"". She is now sheltering with friends in another part of the country. ""I get death threats all the time through comments and DMs."" Bobrisky - probably Nigeria's most high-profile cross-dressing personality, with 4.5 million followers on Instagram - mocked the efforts to change the law by sarcastically tweeting that it would help solve the country's security problems and power shortages, as well as improve Nigeria's reputation abroad and reduce inflation. Famous drag queen James Brown highlighted the exemption the proposed law would give to entertainers, goading the amendment's supporters.  ""Do your research before you come for me. My job is to entertainâ¦ Don't underestimate the power that I carry. Ask my fans,"" she posted on Instagram. National Assembly member Muda Lawal Ulnar is behind the proposed amendment. He has not explained his motivation, which may only come out when the bill goes for its second reading.  But a comment on a legal affairs website from a supporter of the amendment indicates the logic. Lawyer Manfred Ekpe said the National Assembly should be allowed to set standards for a ""morally upright society"". As well as citing verses from the Bible and the Quran, Mr Ekpe argued that cross-dressing eroded the moral standards of young people and children.  ""There is nothing wrong in making law to prohibit conduct likely to lead to the promotion of offensive conduct or commission of an offence such as homosexuality,"" he wrote. There is clearly the feeling that a man wearing women's clothes or vice-versa would somehow encourage people to have a same-sex relationship. Nigeria is generally a conservative society and people who step outside the norms can be targeted. A recently shared tweet embedded a video showing a man who, it said, was reeling from an attack because he had been wearing women's clothes.  This kind of treatment comes as no surprise to designer Lolu Vangei ""Jordyn"", who is a 23-year-old trans man. He has been assaulted in public. ""Even before the bill, I had already started getting loads of transphobia,"" he told the BBC. ""I went to the market one day with my binders on [which can be used to flatten the chest], and some man just touched my chest area to feel it. I interrogated him for doing that, and he slapped me before beckoning his male friends to come see a 'woman that dresses like a man'."" Looking at the proposed changes to the law, anyone - straight or gay - could in theory be profiled and arrested for simply wearing clothes or accessories that do not conform to someone's idea of how men and women should appear.  ""To start with, I think it's nonsense,"" Jordyn said. ""What happens to a straight woman who wears shorts and baggy jeans, or a straight man that loves braiding his hair, wears chains, or even tank tops?"" These are obvious problems with the proposal which may see it fail. But for queer, trans and non-binary Nigerians it is a reminder of how central clothes are to how they see themselves. ""Clothing helps trans, non-binary and genderqueer people to, in a way, set into their identities,"" Francis said, signifying the importance of dressing expressively, and how this anti-cross-dressing measure could have an adverse effect on Nigeria's fashion community.  ""Restricting people to a particular [way of dressing] based off of the binary genders is very dangerous for us."" LGBTQ+ people can be prone to mental health conditions like body dysmorphia and body dysphoria - where they are anxious about their physical appearance.  As a result, clothing and fashion become fundamental ways to deal with those issues. ""I started [fashion label] Vangei out of my own necessity, because it can be confusing to shop as a trans person in Nigeria, and not getting things that fit right,"" Jordyn said. ""So I decided to create a genderless brand for people that didn't feel good about themselves, and didn't want to identify as either men or women.""  Jordyn focuses mostly on custom-made pieces, because it allows him the opportunity to concentrate on fit and style, a problem many trans and non-binary people face when shopping.  ""Not very many people understand the struggle it is for non-binary people to shop for clothes,"" said 25-year-old designer Emerie Udiahgebi, who recently came into their non-binary identity.  But these young designers do not want the cross-dressing bill to be just the concern of the fashion industry. There are plenty more mainstream designers making clothes for the LGBTQ+ community who activists think should be speaking out. They are actually the ones who could have more of a political impact. But their silence may reflect a fear of not wanting to be singled out. Udiahgebi is worried about the impact that the cross-dressing bill could have if it became law, but is determined it will not make a difference. ""There's going to be a lot of extortions, there's going to be a lot of arrests. I don't know about anyone else, but I don't see a possibility of my disregarding all the stress it took to come into full acceptance of who I am.""

Afghanistan pupils in fear after spate of Islamic State attacks,"Thu, 12 May 2022 23:13:59 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-61404083,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-61404083?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,A spate of Islamic State attacks have left Afghan students in fear and test Taliban security claims.,"Milad is packing his rucksack for the first time since his school in the west of Kabul was attacked by extremists last month. The 15-year-old pupil wasn't hurt when the first bomb went off, but his father raced to the scene to try to find him, only to be killed in a second explosion.  A poster commemorating Mir Hossein hangs outside the family home, along with a few verses of poetry. ""Through your blood, you gave meaning to love,"" reads one line.    ""It feels really hard to go back to school,"" Milad tells us, walking alongside his older brother and uncle. ""My heart doesn't want me to.""  Milad, and most of the residents in his neighbourhood, Dashte-e-Barchi, are members of the Shia Hazara minority. The area has been repeatedly attacked by the local branch of the Islamic State group, who are suspected of being behind the bombing at Milad's school.  ""I was in the classroom about to leave when the explosion happened. We crouched down on the floor with our hands on our heads,"" Milad told the BBC.  After a while, he and the other pupils went outside, jumping over a wall into a neighbouring house. When he reached home, he heard his father had been injured. A short while later they received his dead body.  ""My father was very kind and caring, he was a great support to me,"" he said ruefully.  The school opened up straight after the attack, but some pupils are yet to return, their families too afraid.  Headteacher Ghulam Haider Hussaini told the BBC he was determined not to allow the violence to deter his students.  ""However many attacks happen, we will continue with our education. Because our religion teaches us, from the cradle to the grave, we must learn."" In recent weeks Shia and Sufi Muslim communities have been devastated by a series of bombings by IS, with around 100 people killed in attacks on mosques and minibuses as well as at Milad's school.  IS attacks have been taking place since long before the Taliban takeover last year, but they've now spread to new parts of the country, notably the north with blasts in Mazar-e Sharif and Kunduz.  As the Taliban captured Afghan cities last year, thousands of IS prisoners escaped from prison. IS has also managed to radicalise some members of Afghanistan's Tajik and Uzbek populations, whereas the Taliban are dominated by the Pashtun ethnicity.  IS have even, on two recent occasions it appears, fired across the border into neighbouring Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. Unlike the Taliban, which has repeatedly promised not to allow Afghan soil to be used to plan attacks abroad, IS has avowedly global ambitions.  IS is still far smaller than their fierce rivals the Taliban, however. The group does not control any territory but it does have deadly sleeper cells that have been targeting religious minorities in the country and Taliban patrols.  IS, made up largely of disgruntled Afghan and Pakistani Taliban members, accuse the Taliban of being too moderate, the Taliban label IS extremists.  There's a bloody irony to the Taliban, former insurgents themselves, now coming under fire. One local Taliban official in Kabul admits it's a strange feeling to be responsible for security in a city where he once planned attacks.  Many Afghans, even those not particularly supportive of the Taliban, hoped their arrival would mean the end of decades of fighting in the country. Overall levels of violence are significantly down but IS attacks have continued and they're challenging the Taliban's narrative that they've brought security.  Khalid Zadran is the spokesman for Kabul's Taliban-led police force.  ""A coalition of international countries invaded,"" he says, ""we defeated them, so we will be able to defend Afghanistan against these smaller attacks now.""  Zadran describes the recent bombings as ""cruel,"" adding, ""god willing our brave police will be able to prevent such attacks."" He points out that during the recent Eid festival no major incident occurred, but the Taliban have also been accused of trying to play down the threat from IS in public, anxious to appear in full control.   In the east of the country, where a few years ago IS managed to capture and control pockets of land, before being pushed back, the Taliban's intelligence department has been waging a bloody and murky war against the insurgents.  Elsewhere, on occasion the Taliban have announced successful raids on IS safe houses, or the arrest of their operatives. IS activity had significantly dropped off over the winter, however, the spate of recent attacks, which the group announced was part of its global campaign ""avenging"" the death of its leader in Syria, show it remains a threat.  In Hazara-dominated areas, like the Dashte-e-Barchi neighbourhood in Kabul, a sense of fear pervades every aspect of life.  Even passengers making the daily commute on minibuses serving as shared taxis have been targeted. Onboard one, everyone we speak to is conscious of the dangers.  ""We are attacked everywhere,"" says Shah Jahan Shahid, an assistant professor on his way to work. ""In school, in hospital, in university, in the street. But we don't have any option to save ourselves, we are living in blood.""   Back at Milad's school, he's leaving shortly after having arrived. Sitting and studying there still feels too difficult for now.  ""My father was always there for me,"" he tells the BBC. ""Now he is no more.""

Chelsea and Man City stutter as WSL makes electric return,"Sun, 18 Sep 2022 22:18:52 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62950270,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62950270?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"The return of the Women's Super League sees shock results, record crowds and impressive debut goals, writes Emma Sanders."," Last updated on 18 September 202218 September 2022.From the section Women's Football The Women's Super League made an electric return this weekend with shock results, record crowds and impressive debut goals. Clubs looking to build on the buzz created by England's success at Euro 2022 were made to wait an extra week - after the first round of fixtures were postponed following the death of Queen Elizabeth II - but it was certainly worth it. Questions have been asked of Manchester City after their large list of departures, including the world record transfer of midfielder Keira Walsh to Barcelona, and whether anyone could knock champions Chelsea off their perch. But few would have seen both of those clubs losing on the opening weekend as City were beaten 4-3 in a dramatic and frantic encounter at Villa Park, before Chelsea suffered a shock defeat to newly promoted Liverpool. It was a reminder of the competition facing the top clubs this season as City look set for a challenging battle to secure Champions League qualification. Manager Gareth Taylor was under pressure last season after a poor start during an injury crisis but City clawed it back to finish third, only to lose in the qualification rounds of the Champions League last month. That loss to Real Madrid, compounded by the late departure of Walsh a day before the transfer deadline and now this opening loss to Villa have darkened the clouds hanging over the club. Their defeat was made worse by the fact rivals Manchester United - who many predict will be City's closest challengers for third spot - comfortably beat Reading 4-0 with a slick performance on Saturday.  The pressure on City - and Taylor - to deliver increases as scrutiny of the decision to allow several high-profile players to leave in the transfer window grows. ""The spine of Aston Villa's team was up against a broken spine in Manchester City's team,"" former England goalkeeper Rachel Brown-Finnis said on BBC Two. ""A spine that has been taken apart with players leaving left, right and centre.""  The dramatic scenes continued at Prenton Park as Liverpool, in front of a record 3,006 crowd, scored two second-half penalties to win 2-1 and spoil the start of Chelsea's title defence. Chelsea also lost to Arsenal on the opening day of last season but looked surprisingly short of creativity and quality in the final third against Liverpool on Sunday. Emma Hayes was evidently frustrated and said her team ""couldn't hit a barn door"" on a weekend when rivals Arsenal won 4-0 comfortably at home to Brighton. The Blues lost just twice in the league in 2021-22 but with just one point separating them and runners-up Arsenal last season, they cannot afford to throw away further points against sides they will be expected to beat. Villa showed ambition in the transfer window as they signed England international Rachel Daly, France midfielder Kenza Dali and took Scotland winger Kirsty Hanson on loan. They only scored 13 goals in total last season but any concerns over their ability to do so this year were quickly squashed against City. They were front-footed, aggressive and clinical in front of 6,785 supporters - another record - at Villa Park. ""We wanted to be brave, take risks, create chances and make this a horrible place to play and I think we did that,"" said Daly. It was a demonstration of Villa's intent to ruffle the feathers of those teams at the top of the table in an effort to improve on their ninth-place finish last season. And if anyone wondered if Liverpool were equipped to compete with the best teams in the WSL on their return they were given a clear indication of the Merseyside club's pedigree. The victory over Chelsea marked the hosts' return to the top flight after a two-year absence but they played with the similar belief and confidence which they demonstrated so regularly in the Championship. Under manager Matt Beard, who guided them to back-to-back WSL titles in his first stint in charge, Liverpool have looked robust and clinical - and they needed that on Sunday. Chelsea caused them problems and dominated possession but Liverpool grew into the game and took their chances when they arrived. As Beard said afterwards - ""there shouldn't be any hesitancy anymore"" for Liverpool, who showed their credentials as a team that belong in the WSL. Across the country fans were queuing up outside stadiums and clubs welcomed record crowds as many hoped to see the return of England's Euro winners. Golden Boot winner Beth Mead needed no time to settle back into club football as she scored twice and set-up Sweden striker Stina Blackstenius in Arsenal's victory over Brighton on Friday. Manchester United fans screamed Ella Toone's name as she entered Leigh Sports Village on Saturday and she was full of spark in their victory over Reading, while England team-mate Alessia Russo got off the mark with a header before half-time. Nikita Parris also looked bright in her debut cameo off the bench for United. But it was Aston Villa's new signing Daly who stole the show with two superb goals on her debut in the win over City, while Euro 2022 final goalscorer Chloe Kelly grabbed an assist on the losing side. ""[Daly's] a winner, she sets standards, she gets after people but she can play for sure,"" said Villa boss Ward.

Tesco raises meal deal price as food costs soar,"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 15:49:12 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-63346320,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-63346320?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,It is the first time in 10 years the popular lunch choice has gone up for all customers.,"Tesco has raised the price of its meal deal as food costs soar. The sandwich, snack and drink deal will increase to Â£3.40 for Tesco Clubcard members after more than 10 years being priced at Â£3. It will go from Â£3.50 to Â£3.90 for those without a loyalty card. Food prices are rising at their fastest rate in 42 years, squeezing household budgets and driving grocery inflation to 14.6% in the 12 months to September. Tesco said its meal deal still represented ""great value"". The supermarket said more than 70% of its customers currently use a Clubcard, which is a free card that gives customers discounts. In February, Tesco upped the price of its meal deal from Â£3 to Â£3.50 for non-Clubcard members, but the latest rise marks the first time the popular lunch choice has gone over Â£3 for all customers. Tesco's competitors, such as Sainsbury's and Co-op, offer similar meal deals at Â£3.50 and Â£4 respectively. Boots also increased the price of its meal deal for the second time this year, the Daily Mirror reported. The high street pharmacy chain has increased the standard price of its meal deal from Â£3.59 to Â£3.99, and from Â£4.19 to Â£4.99 in London. Companies are facing increased costs for things like fuel, wages and ingredients, and many firms are now passing those on to customers by raising prices. In July, McDonald's put up the price of its cheeseburger for the first time in more than 14 years, from 99p to Â£1.19, due to growing cost pressures. The fast food firm said its UK restaurants would be adding between 10p and 20p to a number of items. Meanwhile, bakery chain Greggs has warned that its prices could go up for a second time this year. Households have seen food costs rise at the fastest rate since 1980 - with bread, cereal, meat and dairy prices all climbing. The rise in the price of everyday food items and goods has been been accelerated by the war in Ukraine, which has hit grain, oil and fertiliser supplies. Food and drink prices have also been affected by a fall in the value of the pound, which has made imported products and ingredients from abroad more expensive. A BBC survey has uncovered growing concern about the squeeze on finances. Some 85% of those asked are now worried about the rising cost of living, up from 69% in a similar poll in January. As a result, nine in 10 people are trying to save money by delaying putting the heating on and three in five people in the UK will cut back this Christmas.

Who is in the Royal Family and what does the King do? ,"Sun, 18 Sep 2022 13:34:31 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-56201331,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-56201331?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,King Charles III has succeeded Queen Elizabeth II after her death at Balmoral.,"The King has temporarily stepped back from his public duties while he is treated for cancer.  Buckingham Palace has not said what type of cancer the 75-year-old has, but confirmed that it was not prostate cancer.  The King was recently treated for prostate enlargement. In a statement, Buckingham Palace said: ""Regrettably, a number of the King's forthcoming public engagements will have to be rearranged or postponed.  ""His Majesty would like to apologise to all those who may be disappointed or inconvenienced as a consequence."" It added that he ""looks forward to returning to full public duty as soon as possible"". The King will continue with paperwork and private meetings as head of state. His regular weekly meeting with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will continue throughout the King's treatment, although they may not always be face-to-face. This video can not be played Watch: King Charles meets PM after cancer diagnosis While the King is recovering, the Queen is continuing to attend public engagements.  If it became the case that the King was not able to carry out his official duties for a temporary period, two or more members of the Royal Family would be appointed as Counsellors of State, to act in his place. They could include the Queen, the Prince of Wales, the Princess Royal and the Duke of Edinburgh.  The King is the UK head of state, but his powers are largely symbolic and ceremonial. He remains politically neutral. He receives daily dispatches from the government in a red leather box, including briefings ahead of important meetings, or documents needing his signature.      The prime minister normally meets the King on a Wednesday at Buckingham Palace.  These meetings are completely private, and no official records are kept of what is said. The King also has a number of official parliamentary roles: The monarch also leads the annual Remembrance event in November at the Cenotaph in London. The King hosts visiting heads of state, and regularly meets foreign ambassadors and high commissioners.  In the first year of his reign, Charles visited a number of countries, including Germany, France and Kenya. Charles is also head of the Commonwealth, an association of 56 independent countries spanning 2.5 billion people. He is head of state for 14 of these, known as the Commonwealth realms, as well as the Crown dependencies - the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. The Queen undertakes her own public engagements on behalf of the 90 charities she supports.  The order of succession sets out which member of the Royal Family takes over as monarch when the existing one dies or abdicates. First in line - the heir to the throne - is the monarch's eldest child. Sons no longer take precedence over their older sisters.  King Charles's heir is his elder son, the Prince of Wales.  William's eldest child Prince George is second-in-line to the throne, and his daughter Princess Charlotte is third. Her younger brother Prince Louis is fourth and Prince Harry is fifth.  The Royal Family receives an annual payment from the taxpayer, known as the Sovereign Grant, which is used to pay for official expenses, such as the upkeep of properties and staff costs. The amount is based on a proportion of the profits of the Crown Estate, a Â£16.5bn property business owned by the monarch but run independently.  The Sovereign Grant is worth Â£86.3m for 2023-2024, as it was in 2021-2022 and 2022-23, although the Royal Family's total spending was more, with the difference covered by reserves.  To keep the annual payment at the same level of Â£86.3m in 2024-2025, the grant will be a smaller percentage of Crown Estate profits, which have been boosted by six new offshore wind farms.  However, if Crown Estate profits continue to grow as predicted, even under the reduced formula, the amount given to the Royal Family is expected to increase substantially in 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. The King also receives money from a private estate called the Duchy of Lancaster, which is passed down from monarch to monarch. It covers more than 18,000 hectares of land, including property in central London. Worth Â£654m, it generates about Â£20m a year in profits. The Duke of Cornwall (currently William, Prince of Wales) benefits from the Duchy of Cornwall, which mainly owns land in the south-west of England. Worth Â£1bn, it generated a net surplus of Â£24m in 2022-23. The King and William receive the profits from the duchies personally, and can spend the money as they wish. Both voluntarily pay income tax on the proceeds.  Some Royal Family members have private art, jewellery and stamp collections which they can sell or use to generate income as they wish. Charles became King on the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, on 8 September 2022.  On 6 May 2023, Charles and his wife Camilla were crowned by the Archbishop of Canterbury in front of more than 2,000 guests, including global politicians, fellow kings and queens, religious leaders, celebrities and community champions. During the Westminster Abbey ceremony, the King was anointed with ""holy oil"", and received the orb and sceptre, symbols of royalty.  This video can not be played Watch King Charles III be crowned Crowds lined the streets of central London to watch the King and Queen return to Buckingham Palace in a mile-long procession. Two months later, the King was presented with the Scottish crown jewels, in a special service of thanksgiving at St Giles' Cathedral, in Edinburgh. The King and Queen's official residence, Buckingham Palace, is undergoing a 10-year Â£369m refurbishment,. They split their time between Clarence House in London and Highgrove in Gloucestershire. Other Royal residences include Windsor Castle, Sandringham, in Norfolk, the Palace of Holyroodhouse, in Edinburgh, and Balmoral Castle, in Aberdeenshire.  In August 2022, the Prince and Princess of Wales moved from Kensington Palace in west London to live in Adelaide Cottage, on the Windsor Estate. In early 2023, Prince Harry and his wife Meghan were asked to vacate Frogmore Cottage in Windsor, which they had used as their UK base after moving to the US.  A YouGov opinion poll of more than 2,000 adults in Britain ahead of the first anniversary of Queen Elizabeth's death suggested a sharp generational divide. Overall, 62% wanted to keep the monarchy, with 26% backing an elected head of state - up from 17% a decade earlier.  But while 80% of the over-65s supported the monarchy, only 37% of 18 to 24-year-olds agreed.  There was also less support for the royals in Scotland or Wales than in England, where London had higher levels of people against the monarchy than anywhere else in the country.

How can I offer a UK home to Ukrainian refugees?,"Fri, 06 May 2022 13:40:01 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/60735121,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/60735121?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The government has launched two schemes to let Ukrainian refugees come to the UK.,"Some unaccompanied child refugees from Ukraine will be given visas, the government has announced. The Home Office changed its initial guidance to say that under-18s must travel with a parent or guardian, which left hundreds of lone teenagers in limbo.   Almost 100,000 Ukrainians have arrived in the UK after fleeing the Russian invasion.   As of 19 July, 162,000 Ukrainian visas have been issued, from 194,700 applications: As of 18 July, 95,400 visa holders have arrived in the UK: In addition, 15,500 Ukrainians who were already in the UK at the time of the invasion have had their permission to stay extended. As of 14 July, 14,200 Ukrainian children have places in English schools. There are no equivalent figures for Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.  Family members and potential hosts have consistently complained about the time taken for visas to be approved. Home Secretary Priti Patel apologised for the ""frustrating"" delays. EU countries allow Ukrainian refugees to stay for up to three years without a visa.  More than 5.9 million Ukrainians have been recorded in neighbouring European countries since the war began, although many have since returned. The Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme - ""Homes for Ukraine"" - lets those without relatives in the UK come for at least six months.  Any Ukrainian national - or immediate family member - who lived in Ukraine before 1 January 2022 qualifies. People with Ukrainian passports can apply online, but those without have to go to a visa application centre (VAC) in a neighbouring country, including child applicants.  Those granted visas can live and work in the UK for up to three years, and access healthcare, welfare and schools.  They can also bring their pets. On 22 June, the government announced that some unaccompanied child refugees will be able to come to the UK. Weeks after the scheme began, the Home Office updated its guidance to say under-18s must travel with a parent or guardian, or be reuniting with them in the UK. But about 1,000 young people travelling on their own had already applied to come to the UK. The government said that initially only those already in the system will be granted a visa.  For safeguarding reasons, those offering to sponsor children must generally either be a relative or known to their parents. Anyone in the UK - of any nationality, providing they have at least six months' leave to remain - can volunteer to host the refugees in their own home, or another property.    Charities, businesses and community groups can also apply. Hosts are offered a tax-free payment of Â£350 a month for up to 12 months.  Local authorities receive Â£10,500 in extra funding per refugee for support services, with additional money available for schoolchildren. At the moment people can only apply to sponsor a specific Ukrainian individual or family.  Those without a personal connection can register their interest, and contact refugees through charities, faith groups or local community organisations, including:  The government gave Reset an initial grant of Â£300,000 to run a matching and training service. Many unofficial Facebook groups have also been set up to connect refugees and potential sponsors. The government says everyone who applies to host is vetted, and Ukrainian applicants also undergo security checks. Local councils should approve each property and complete basic Disclosure and Barring Service checks on all potential hosts. However, ""enhanced checks"" are only requested if children are involved. The BBC found evidence that some predatory men were using the sponsorship scheme to prey on young women. In April, the UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR, raised concerns about the UK system, calling for ""adequate safeguards and vetting measures to be in place against exploitation"". In EU countries, matching is mainly organised by national authorities and charities, with fewer private arrangements. Some refugees have had to be rehoused after being placed in unsuitable accommodation.  The family visa scheme was initially limited to those hoping to join immediate family in the UK, but now includes extended family members.  It is open to Ukrainian nationals - or immediate family members - who lived in Ukraine before 1 January 2022. Applications from people without passports must be made at a VAC, and applicants must provide biometric information, such as fingerprints. Those with a Ukrainian passport can apply online, with biometric information provided after arrival.  People granted family visas can live, work and study in the UK, and access public funds for up to three years.  Separately, Ukrainian nationals granted permission to stay in the UK on or before 18 March 2022 can apply to stay in the UK under the Ukraine Extension Scheme. Their partner and children can also apply if they're already in the UK as ""dependants"".

How Paralympic couple got pregnancy news in supermarket,"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 05:14:16 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/disability-sport/63296957,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/disability-sport/63296957?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,British wheelchair basketball stars Laurie Williams and Robyn Love discuss starting a family - and how they found out about their pregnancy in a supermarket.,"Laurie Williams and Robyn Love are set to have a child next year A tiny pair of shoes, placed in front of a board bearing a few simple words: 'Baby Love. Due April 2023.' With that one post on Instagram, Laurie Williams and Robyn Love - the British wheelchair basketball stars who went viral after announcing their engagement in 2020 - threatened to break the internet once more. This time, it was with the news that Williams was pregnant.  ""So many people that we haven't even met before are reaching out and saying 'congratulations',"" Love says with a smile. ""A baby seems to bring light to things, and any time something positive happens, I really do think it's important that it's celebrated. We're really grateful we can offer a little something out into the world."" Williams adds: ""It still doesn't seem real. ""This is going to be our last Christmas without pooey nappies and vomitâ¦ we're thinking of what we do to make the most of it!"" This video can not be played From August 2021: Robyn Love answers pupils' questions Like many parents-to-be, Love and Williams are eager to share their journey with the world.  And as a same-sex couple navigating the challenges of prospective parenthood, the pair are particularly keen to talk about their story, in the hope it might help others who are going through the same thing.  ""It's been something we always talked about once we'd got to a certain phase of our relationship,"" Williams says.  ""We're in a really good position to start a family, but when you're in a same-sex relationship, it can take lots more planning, potentially. We had to go down the path of IVF and knew it could take quite a lot of time, but fortunately for us, it worked first time. It was still a lot of hard work and it wasn't an easy journey to go through, but it happened nicely for us in terms of timings."" When going through IVF, there was also the discussion as to who would carry the baby. Love laughs: ""First of all, you've got to do 'rock, paper, scissors' for who is going to go first between you. ""And it was a natural choice for it to be Laurie - it felt right between us. But I was certainly overwhelmed by the amount of options available. We were very fortunate that we got the NHS route, so we're really grateful for the opportunity."" Williams and Love were Great Britain wheelchair basketball team-mates at the 2020 Paralympics in Tokyo At first, the couple told only a handful of relatives and close friends about their decision to start a family. ""We didn't want that disappointment if it didn't work out first time,"" Love admits. ""It's a scary thing. There are a lot of expectations and things Laurie has had to put her body through - and if at the end of it she didn't become pregnant, it could be quite a rollercoaster. ""For both of us being athletes, we never expect success and we don't want to celebrate until that finish line is crossed."" That moment came this summer. ""I was at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, representing Scotland,"" Love says. ""Laurie and I met to get a coffee and were just looking for somewhere to do the pregnancy test where we wouldn't be interrupted, to be honest. ""So we found a toilet in Morrisons supermarket, and that's where we found outâ¦ and it was a bit surreal, bizarre! You know, I'm at the Commonwealth Games, going through this crazy experience, so to have that positive result on that day was just fantastic.""

As parents-to-be, they plan to keep doing that. ""The representation is getting better and better,"" Williams says. ""Things keep popping up on my Instagram of children who come from all sorts of different families, whether it's single-parent or same-sex.  ""It's just great and more stuff should be like that, because children don't mind. ""They just want to be loved and looked after and treated with kindness - and hopefully, we'll show the world that, whoever you've chosen to start a family with, if you can give a child those things, that's the most important thing.""  It's not just LGBTQ+ parents who the couple hope to inspire with their story, but any woman looking to balance motherhood with a career in elite sport.  ""There are so many examples now of women who are taking time away to have children,"" Love says.  ""I think nowadays, the sporting bodies are working out how to make it work so that kids can come on camps and tournaments, and not be a hinderance - but that being a mum and being present with your child can actually make you a better performer. ""That's the sort of area in sport that's going to adapt or change. ""At least, I hope that it is."" Robyn Love and Laurie Williams were speaking to Jack Murley on the BBC's LGBT Sport Podcast.

What is the windfall tax on oil and gas companies and how does it work?,"Wed, 07 Sep 2022 14:00:01 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60295177,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60295177?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,New PM Liz Truss has ruled out using a further windfall tax to fund energy price measures.,"The windfall tax on oil and gas companies has been extended by a year - until March 2029 - Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced in the Budget. The Energy Profits Levy, introduced as a response to soaring profits in May 2022, raised Â£2.6bn in its first year. A windfall tax is a levy imposed by a government on companies that have benefited from something they were not responsible for - in other words, a windfall. Energy firm profits soared because of rising demand after Covid restrictions were lifted, and then because Russia's invasion of Ukraine raised energy prices. The windfall tax applies to profits made from extracting UK oil and gas. BP made $13.8bn (Â£11bn) in 2023, down from the record $27.7bn in 2022. Shell profits were $28.2bn (Â£22.3bn) in 2023, down from $39.9bn in 2022 - the highest earnings in its 115-year history.  BP says its UK businesses account for less than 10% of global profits, while Shell makes about 5% of its revenue in the UK. British Gas profits for 2023 increased 10-fold to Â£750m. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak introduced the 25% Energy Profits Levy (EPL) in May 2022, when he was chancellor. Mr Hunt increased the windfall tax to 35% in January 2023. And in the 2024 Budget he announced it would remain in place until March 2029 - because, he said, the continuing war in Ukraine would extend windfall profits for energy companies. The government has said the windfall tax will end if oil and gas prices drop below a certain level for six months. For that to happen, average oil prices must fall to, or be below, $71.40 per barrel, and Â£0.54 per therm for gas, for two consecutive quarters. In 2022, the government also brought in a levy on what it called ""extraordinary returns"" from low-carbon electricity generators in the UK. Larger operators started paying the Electricity Generator Levy on 1 January 2023. The government hopes it will raise about Â£14bn over six years. In the first tax year the windfall tax was in place 2022-2023, HMRC received Â£2.6bn from it. It had been forecast to bring in Â£5bn in the first year.  BP said its North Sea business paid $1.5bn (Â£1.2bn) UK tax in 2023, of which $720m was due to the EPL.  The year before, it paid $2.2bn in tax for its North Sea operations, including $700m from the EPL. Shell said it paid Â£178m in UK windfall tax for 2022. A company spokeswoman said the company paid Â£1.1bn in overall tax in the UK for 2023, of which Â£240m was taxed under the Energy Profits Levy. Oil and gas firms operating in the North Sea are taxed differently. They pay 30% corporation tax on their profits and a supplementary 10% rate on top of that. Other firms with profits over Â£250,000 a year currently pay 25% corporation tax. But oil and gas firms have been able to reduce the amount of tax they pay by factoring in losses or spending on things like decommissioning North Sea oil platforms. As a result BP and Shell have paid almost no UK tax in recent years. Both firms received more money back from the UK government than they paid every year from 2015 to 2020 (except Shell in 2017).  Shell also paid a negative amount of tax in 2021, taking its 2015 to 2021 UK tax total to -Â£685m. In January 2023, Shell announced that it would pay UK tax for the first time since 2017. BP paid more money in tax than it received back in 2021, taking its total for the same period to -Â£107m.  Companies are offered big tax benefits if they invest in oil and gas extraction. For every Â£100 they invest they can claim back Â£91.40 in tax relief. And if they spend Â£100 decarbonising the way they extract oil and gas they can claim up to Â£109.25 in tax benefits. But Gilad Myerson from Ithaca Energy, a company developing the Rosebank oilfield, told BBC News ""we have slowed down our investment programme quite significantly because of the instability"" caused by the windfall tax.  The Â£3.1bn investment in Rosebank will qualify the companies involved for up to Â£2.9bn in tax relief. In November 2022, Shell said it would ""have to evaluate each project on a case-by-case basis"", having previously planned to invest up to Â£25bn over the next decade. BP plans to spend up to Â£18bn on the UK's energy system by 2030 and said in May 2022 that all planned UK investments would continue.

"Influencers and followers need more protection, say MPs","Mon, 09 May 2022 00:05:59 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-61347936,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-61347936?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,MPs say the growth of online culture has outpaced employment and advertising regulations.,"MPs are calling for more protection for social media influencers and the children who follow them. The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Committee says the growth of online culture has rapidly outpaced current employment and advertising regulations. Their report details how some child influencers are at risk of exploitation. They also warn that influencers are not complying with advertising rules. DCMS Committee Chairman Julian Knight said: ""If you dig below the shiny surface of what you see on screen you will discover an altogether murkier world, where both the influencers and their followers are at risk of exploitation and harm online."" The Committee found the market for child influencers is booming, with many young people earning income through sponsorships and brand partnerships.  The report says many of these accounts on TikTok, YouTube and Instagram are being run and managed by their parents - which raised concerns that the children were being exploited to make money.  Posting content about children can also affect their privacy and bring security risks - something MPs say should be addressed, along with ensuring a right to erasure.  But it is not just children as influencers that is a concern - it is also children as viewers.  The report warns that those who are developing digital literacy are in particular danger online. Influencer content on social media is becoming an increasingly popular media genre for children, particularly on YouTube. According to Ofcom, in 2021 up to half of children said they watched vloggers or YouTube influencers. Disinformation and harmful messages are also a problem for those online and under 18, who are more vulnerable to embedded advertising. The DCMS Committee recommends that the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) should strengthen disclosure standards for adverts online targeting children. Social media influencing is becoming a popular career choice. Of the 511 British children surveyed as part of the inquiry, more than 32% said they would consider becoming an influencer.  Mr Knight continued: ""The explosion in influencer activity has left the authorities playing catch-up, and exposed the impotence of advertising rules and employment protections designed for a time before social media was the all-encompassing behemoth it has become today.  ""This report has held a mirror up to the problems which beset the industry, where for too long it has been a case of lights, camera, inaction.  ""It is now up to the Government to reshape the rules to keep pace with the changing digital landscape and ensure proper protections for all."" The Online Safety Bill is a landmark piece of legislation which aims to keep people safe on the internet.  The Government says it will encompass everything from eradicating hate speech, protecting young people from ""eating disorder"" content, clamping down on scammers and fining the big tech firms if they fail to comply.  The DCMS Committee recommends the Government use the Online Safety Bill to ensure that reporting and complaints mechanisms are tailored to meet the specific nature of harms faced by influencers.  The MPs say there should also be a comprehensive study into the UK's influencer ecosystem, so the Government can more effectively regulate the industry as it grows. Influencers often spend a long time producing financially lucrative content for other people without fair reward, say the MPs, noting that most work for themselves, and so have uneven earnings and a lack of employment protections.  Influencers are still failing to clearly label their paid for or sponsored content, according to the report.  The MPs recommend more powers are given to the ASA to enforce the law. The body is currently not allowed to impose fines on those who do not comply,  The ASA said: ""We will consider carefully the recommendations in the DCMS Committee Report on Influencer Culture that relate to advertising."" The Competition and Markets Authority told the inquiry that influencer compliance rates with UK advertising regulations are still unacceptably low.  In 2020, a monitoring exercise by the ASA found that just 35% of 24,000 marketing posts on the Instagram accounts of 122 UK-based influencers were clearly labelled as adverts..

Kwasi Kwarteng: We stopped consumer spending collapse,"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 21:08:29 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-63079743,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-63079743?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng says he will stick to his tax cut plan despite days of market turmoil.,"This video can not be played Chancellor Kwarteng is asked whether the government will stick to past pledges linking pension and benefits rises to inflation. Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng has said his mini-budget was needed to stop a collapse in consumer spending, despite it sparking days of market turmoil.  He told his party's MPs that cutting taxes and limiting energy bills had protected the economy.  The plans, announced last Friday, led to a slump in the pound and the Bank of England stepping in to prevent the collapse of some pension funds. Mr Kwarteng and Prime Minister Liz Truss defended their plans on Thursday. In a series of BBC interviews, Ms Truss insisted ""urgent action"" was needed to boost the UK economy, adding she was ""prepared to do what it takes to make that happen"" and that the tax cuts outlined last week were the right plan. This comes as a Yougov poll suggested Labour had opened up a massive 33-point lead over the Tories. Mr Kwarteng tried to bolster support among Tory MPs by sending them a message saying he was working at pace to show markets he had a ""clear plan"".  The chancellor said he understood their concern about the mini-budget, which promised Â£45bn of tax cuts funded by government borrowing. Fears this would be unaffordable and drive up interest rates had sent markets into a panic, with government borrowing costs surging, and the pound hitting a record low on Monday. The market turmoil was fuelled by the lack of an independent forecast on the impact of the plans, which had been offered by the Office for Budget Responsibility, but was declined by the government. Mr Kwarteng insisted the market volatility was ""global"" and being driven by the Ukraine war, Covid, and ""a super strong US dollar"".  He added that the government had needed to ""act quickly"". ""However I totally understand the need to be credible with markets,"" he told MPs. ""We will show markets our plan is sound, credible and will work to drive growth."" He said the government would announce reforms in ""childcare, business regulations, financial services, agriculture and more"" over the next six weeks. Ms Truss also argued market turmoil was being caused by global factors in a series of interviews with BBC local radio stations. She insisted that ""currencies are under pressure around the world"". Later, in BBC TV interviews, she said the UK was ""in a very serious situation"" but that was due to ""the aftermath of Covid and Putin's war in Ukraine"". This video can not be played Watch: PM quizzed on mini-budget by BBC political editors The Treasury select committee, which is led by Conservative MP Mel Stride, an ally of former leadership contender Rishi Sunak, rejected the government explanation. In a letter to Mr Kwarteng on Thursday, Mr Stride said the government plans had ""resulted in various significant and concerning reactions in the markets"". He said a drop in the price of government bonds following the announcement of the plans was greater than ""any movement during the global financial crisis or the pandemic"". He said the financial impact of the mini-budget was larger than that of a typical Budget, but there had been no assessment by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to go with it, despite the OBR saying it could produce one. ""It is hard to conclude other than that an absence of a forecast has in some part driven the lack of confidence in the markets,"" he said. ""Some may have formed the unfortunate impression that the government may be seeking to avoid scrutiny."" The OBR said on Thursday it had offered to provide a forecast for the mini-budget, but the chancellor had rejected that. BBC economics editor Faisal Islam said this absence of a forecast had made the market reaction to the plans worse. Mr Stride called on Mr Kwarteng to provide an OBR forecast ""earlier"" than 23 November, when the government is due to publish its medium term fiscal plan. The OBR said on Thursday it had been asked by Mr Kwarteng to produce a first draft of its next economic forecasts by 7 October. In an unusual move, Ms Truss will hold emergency talks with OBR head Richard Hughes on Friday, along with Mr Kwarteng. Analysis Zoe Conway, BBC News correspondent In this message, the chancellor is seeking to reassure MPs that he is working quickly to come up with a plan to calm the markets. In the face of mounting criticism from his backbenchers, he is also urging them to stay united. On 23 November, Mr Kwarteng is due to set out his medium term fiscal plan. He argues this will show how he intends to get debt falling but he has been coming under pressure from Conservative MPs to act more quickly. There is scepticism among MPs that the economic growth needed to pay for the announced tax cuts and the government's energy bills intervention can be generated quickly enough.  That's why, in this note to Conservative MPs, he says that there are lots of ''ambitious'' supply side reforms coming over the next six weeks. The chancellor might be conciliatory in tone, saying he always values colleagues and that he is ''always available for a meeting'', but there is no hint here that he is prepared to backtrack on any aspect of his economic plan. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Mr Kwarteng rejected claims the government's plans had made people worse off by contributing to a spike in UK mortgage rates. It is the first time Mr Kwarteng has made a public comment on his mini-budget since Sunday, when he hinted there were more tax cuts to come.  Since then the plan has faced widespread criticism, with the International Monetary Fund and former Bank of England governor Mark Carney disparaging the plan.  On Wednesday, the Bank of England was forced to intervene, pledging to buy $65bn of government bonds in a bid to calm markets.  However, there are concerns the turmoil could continue and fears it might affect the housing market. A record number of mortgage products have been pulled since Friday, amid fears the Bank of England will have to raise interest rates much more sharply than previously expected. Mr Kwarteng said the government's plan to limit energy bills for households and businesses would save people ""thousands of pounds a year"". However, the chancellor said it was too early to say whether he would keep the previous government's promise to increase benefits next April in line with inflation.  He did, however, say the prime minister was committed to reinstating the triple lock on pensions, which means they increase by whichever is highest: inflation, the average wage rise, or 2.5%.

The man looking after the island loved by Star Wars fans,"Sat, 13 Aug 2022 05:55:39 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-62280677,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-62280677?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"For 34 years, Pat O'Shea has been caretaker of an ancient monastic island beloved by Star Wars fans.","For the last 34 years, Pat O'Shea has looked after a rocky island that once housed a monastic settlement, was attacked by Vikings, and is beloved by Star Wars fans. Each Monday between April and October, he steps out of his house, looks across the rugged expanse of County Kerry and to the Atlantic Ocean beyond.  He eyes the often choppy, frigid waters with an inquisitive eye, trying to judge whether the swells might hamper his weekly commute to work. At 07:00, he rings the owner of the transport boat moored alongside the village of Portmagee, to determine whether he and his small team will make it across for work on Sceilg MhichÃ­l (the Irish spelling of Skellig Michael) - the largest of the two Skellig islands, and one of Ireland's national monuments.  Pat and his colleagues at the Office of Public Works (OPW), a state agency, are the caretakers of this world-renowned rocky crag, about 12km off Ireland's south-west coast.  It's a dramatic location, with its soaring jagged cliffs and abundant birdlife, particularly puffins.  Its smaller sibling, just across from it, is famed for its massive colony of tens of thousands of gannets.  The south peak of Sceilg MhichÃ­l is 218m high and was used as a hermitage by monks, with the 183m-high lower peak containing the main monastic site.  The remote hermitage and well-preserved monastery, reputedly founded in the 6th Century by St FionÃ¡n, is also one of the island of Ireland's three Unesco World Heritage sites, along with the Giant's Causeway in County Antrim, and BrÃº na BÃ³inne in County Meath.  And thanks to Luke Skywalker, who lived in self-imposed exile for several years on the island sanctuary, which doubled as a watery planet in a galaxy far, far away in two Star Wars films, its allure has been further enhanced. Pat thinks that while the island's appearance in 2015's The Force Awakens and 2017's The Last Jedi brought Hollywood glamour to the area and boosted visitor numbers, the swell may have peaked.  ""The Skelligs have long been an interesting place to come to well before Star Wars, but it has increased numbers,"" he says.  As the island's district foreman, Sceilg MhichÃ­l has been Pat's place of work in the spring and summer months for the past 34 years.  He and his small team live on the island between Monday and Friday and sometimes longer if bad weather, which comes often, leaves them ""marooned"", which it has on occasion.  He brings with him on the roughly hour long boat trip from the mainland one bag with clothes and a second with provisions - drinking water and food, including plenty of fresh vegetables.  ""You have to make it your home,"" he says.  ""You can't come out and live on beans for the week, or else you'll have health problems. You have to do proper cooking and try to have a proper meal."" This video can not be played Star Wars comes to Skellig Michael in County Kerry Living conditions on the island for the small numbers who work there have improved over the years, but they're still relatively primitive.  Solar panels provide electricity for their huts, which come complete with a small gas cooker, and there's also a shared composting toilet.  Given the remote location, they also must bring with them maintenance supplies.  Pat's speciality is dry-stone walling, and he's never short of tasks.  ""There is always upkeep on the monastery and the steps to make sure that they are safe for people to climb up,"" he says. ""We have to make sure that everything is correct and proper. To make sure there are no loose steps or any wall is dislodged.""  In 2021, 12,060 people visited the island, which was closed in 2020 due to Covid. Safety is paramount.  Daily visitors are limited to 180, with tourists gone for the day by late afternoon, leaving just Pat and his team, three guides who live on the island on rotation throughout the summer, and the vast population of seabirds.  The 2022 visitor season runs from May until 1 October.  ""I like the solitude and the peace of the island, but if you get a lot of cold weather, with fronts coming in and fog, you could be marooned for some time, and maybe time can feel a bit long,"" he says.  ""But in general, I like my work, which is a big bonus. I get great job satisfaction."" From 08:00 to 20:00, the work days are long and are usually rounded off with a meal, some chat, and maybe a bit of fishing off the pier.  ""I used to put out a lobster pot in the mornings and hope that I'd get a lobster crab for my tea,"" Pat says.  ""Everybody has their own bits of interest. ""Talking is very important and socialising with one another. Before, one time, we used to have the lighthouse. It was a great place to visit, but there are no lightkeepers now. We'd have a game of cards. The evening time is nice and peaceful here."" Robert Harris, the head guide for the island, has been coming each season for the last 35 years.  Originally from the United States, he and his County Kerry-born wife have been living in County Leitrim since the 1980s, which was when he responded to a local newspaper advert he saw for guides on the island.  There are five guides in total, with three living on the island for a two-week period, followed by a week off, and then back for another two weeks, continuing between May and October.  Their job is to look after the 180 daily visitors.  ""It's a wilderness environment. And some people might not know exactly what they're dealing with when they get there,"" Robert says.  He continues to be struck by the emotional effect the island has on those who visit the monastery and hermitage.  ""There are so few opportunities any more for people to live that type of life,"" Robert says.   ""It is nice to keep a perspective open on a different way of living, and the island represents something like that.  ""When visitors go up and look at a place where monks lived so long ago, and we have this very precious and tangible isolated spot where you can go out and have physical contact with a different vision, it is incredibly good."" Like Pat, he thinks the Star Wars hype around the island has seen its peak.  ""We get people who come out dressed up in the regalia. I have discovered over the last three or four years fascinating aspects of the Star Wars world,"" he says.  He recalls giving one young Star Wars fan who suffered from a serious illness a tour of the island some years ago.  ""I spent about an hour with him. He talked to me all about the Force, the good and the bad, the light and the dark.  ""I thought afterwards, you just couldn't argue with that."" He worries about the long-term effect of having so many people visiting, and says numbers have to be ""monitored all the time for preservation reasons"". ""My love for the place hasn't waned. I'm more protective of it than I used to be as I realise that it is a fragile and unusual place,"" he says.  The Irish government last December published its second 10-year management plan to ensure its preservation.  The plan commits to monitor the effect of visitor numbers on the island, with the 180 daily limit to be reviewed annually. Other measures include preventing unauthorised drone and helicopter flights, enhancing and restoring the former lighthouse buildings, and the continuation of a seabird monitoring programme to ensure the sustainability of the island's colonies.  For fellow guide Catherine Merrigan, the nature on the island is her passion.  ""The birdlife here is just incredible. The island is just teeming with life,"" she says.  Originally from County Wexford, Catherine has been coming to the island as a guide each summer, bar one, since the year 2000.  On her first night there, though, the remoteness overwhelmed her.  ""It was quite a shock at the very beginning, because when I came out here I didn't realise the isolation of it. I probably would not have stayed, but there were no boats out for five days and by then I just got a love for the place,"" she says.  ""I realised how special the place was, and I still can say it to this day now. It has its challenges, like any place on earth that you work."" Those challenges include pretty miserable weather, with rain, storms and fog where you can ""barely see past your nose"".  For Pat and others, though, the advantages of island life outweigh the challenges.  ""It's a peaceful place to be,"" he says.   ""We get paid to come out here, but I don't think any pay would satisfy you if you didn't have a love for the place, and if you didn't have a special interest in what you were doing here.""

Flight cancellations - why are there so many?,"Mon, 06 Jun 2022 15:57:28 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/61660238,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/61660238?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"There has been significant disruption at UK airports, with flights cancelled and long queues at airports.","Flight cancellations and airport delays are expected to continue this summer, affecting many people's holiday plans. British Airways and EasyJet have already removed about 40,000 flights from their schedules. Heathrow has asked airlines not to sell any more summer tickets, as it struggles to cope with increased passenger numbers.  British Airways (BA) is cutting nearly 30,000 flights from its April-to-October schedule in response to staffing problems.  About a million existing bookings on domestic and European routes from London Heathrow, Gatwick and City airports have been cancelled. Long-haul flights are unaffected. EasyJet has pulled 10,000 flights between July and September. In June, airlines were given a limited window to temporarily hand back without penalty any summer airport slots they would struggle to operate.  Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said this would ""help airlines provide certainty to passengers and ensure the next few months are as smooth as possible"". But Ryanair criticised the plan, insisting it will run its full flight schedule. The UK's biggest airport Heathrow has told airlines to stop selling summer tickets. It wants to limit the number of passengers departing each day over the peak holiday period to 100,000, which is 4,000 fewer than currently scheduled. Former BA boss Willie Walsh, now director general of the International Air Transport Association, criticised the ""ridiculous"" move.  Emirates has refused to comply with what it called an ""unreasonable and unacceptable"" request. It said Heathrow now faced ""an 'airmageddon' situation due to [its] incompetence and non-action"". Gatwick Airport has already reduced flight slots this summer to 825 a day in July and 850 in August, down from 900 in previous years. The new boss of Manchester Airport has warned passengers not to expect a ""great"" experience this summer. Passengers have a number of rights under UK law if they are: Airlines must offer the choice of a refund or alternative flight, regardless of how far in advance the cancellation was made. Return tickets must be fully refunded if either leg is cancelled. And passengers have a right to be booked on another airline - or other suitable mode of transport - if it is going to their destination significantly sooner. Security staff, baggage handlers and airline cabin crew are also taking industrial action in a number of European countries.  Ryanair staff in Belgium, France, Italy, Portugal and Spain have been striking over working conditions and pay. EasyJet cabin crew in Spain working from Palma, Barcelona and Malaga are striking for nine days in July, over three separate 72-hour periods in July: 1 to 3, 15 to 17, and 29 to 31.  The company said customers might experience some disruption, but that ""at this stage"" it planned to operate its full schedule. However, planned strike action by BA check-in staff at Heathrow has been called off after unions said the airline had made a ""vastly improved"" pay offer. In June, 700 workers voted to strike, after BA failed to reverse a 10% pay cut imposed during the peak of the pandemic.  Demand for travel has grown sharply since the final Covid travel restrictions were lifted, but many firms are struggling to cope. Airlines UK, the industry body, said companies have cut about 30,000 jobs since the pandemic began, having employed 74,000 people in 2019. Airports across Europe are also experiencing shortages, with operators in France reporting at least 4,000 vacancies.  Many airport staff who were laid off after the start of the pandemic have since taken jobs in other fields. Unions accused the government and airlines of failing to properly prepare for the end of lockdown. Gemma Antrobus, from the Association of Independent Tour Operators, said: ""Getting back to those levels of staffing, of training, is not as quick and as simple as just a flick of a light switch."" Airport security staff shortages are a particular problem, as it can take months to get workers the clearance they need to operate airside. Swissport's UK boss, Jude Winstanley, said his company had hired 3,000 people since January, but many of them still did not have full security clearance, limiting the duties they could carry out. The government changed the rules at the end of April to allow new staff to receive training while waiting for their final clearance.

Max Whitlock: Olympic champion felt like 'complete failure' after retirement thoughts,"Sat, 24 Sep 2022 00:02:35 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/gymnastics/63005037,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/gymnastics/63005037?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Three-time Olympic gold medallist Max Whitlock ""felt like a complete failure"" when he contemplated stepping away from the sport after the Tokyo Games.","This video can not be played Max Whitlock: Olympic champion felt like 'complete failure' after retirement thoughts Three-time Olympic gold medallist Max Whitlock says he ""felt like a complete failure"" when he contemplated stepping away from the sport after the Tokyo Games. He said his accolades ""didn't matter"" because he could not see a clear path for his future. With his target-focused and motivated mindset gone, the 29-year-old said he ""struggled"" with his mental health. ""I just never in a million years thought I'd feel like it,"" he said. Whitlock secured two gold medals in Tokyo in 2021 to add to the gold and bronze he won at the 2016 Rio Games and two bronzes clinched at London 2012. His other honours include four European Championship golds, four Commonwealth Games golds and three World Championship golds. After some time off following Tokyo, the Team GB star decided he was done with the sport.  Whitlock extends break Whitlock trains with freestyle skier Katie Summerhayes Olympic legacy of Essex club inspires new generation But after speaking about his issues and thinking about the example he wanted to set his three-year-old daughter Willow, Whitlock has confirmed he is now targeting the Paris Games in 2024. Speaking to BBC Breakfast he said: ""As a gymnast throughout my whole career, I've always looked forward and I've never looked back. ""[My results] kind of were amazing, but it didn't matter because I was looking at my next target.    ""Moving forward, that's what mattered, and that's [when] I felt like a complete failure because I couldn't see that clearly."" Whitlock is now back training after taking a break from the sport after Tokyo, missing the 2022 Commonwealth Games - where he worked as a BBC pundit - and next month's World Championships in Liverpool. Whitlock said he started to feel ""completely lost"" following the Tokyo Olympics. ""I fell into a place, into this rut where I just lost all motivation for everything,"" he said. ""I felt sluggish every single day. I was in this place where I just didn't want to do anything. ""I even got a blood test because I was just feeling awful every single day. The blood test come back and I was absolute fine. I think that is what proved to me that it was all in my head."" He recalled sitting in his home, getting upset while speaking to his wife Leah and feeling like a ""complete waste of space"". Whitlock added while he could not ""comprehend"" how he was feeling, Leah and others around him were worried.  ""A lot of people say it, talk to people, get it out it helps,"" he said. ""But I think I've never been that person. I've always been the person to just keep it in and plough on through. I've done [that for my] whole career of almost putting a mask up. ""I think as I started to talk to Leah or started talk to my parents more and the people around me, I started to actually realise how I was feeling."" After Tokyo, Whitlock said he was ""adamant"" he was ending his gymnastics career. But he said it was the thought of explaining the decision to his daughter Willow in the future which made him decide to continue. ""It wouldn't be retiring"" he said. ""It won't be just stopping because of any reason like that. It would be quitting... ""[Willow] obviously would look up to what I am doing. Ten to 20 years down the line if I was explaining my career to Willow and said I have done this and that and then I stopped after Tokyo, I think her next question would probably be why did you stop? And I wouldn't want that to be because I'm scared of failing in Paris."" Max Whitlock says his daughter Willow gives him a new perspective Whitlock is targeting more success - and history - at the Paris 2024 Games. If he can win a medal on the pommel horse he will become the first gymnast to do so at four consecutive Olympics on the same piece of apparatus. He said being back training has been ""tough"" after a year away and is aware of the challenge that faces him. ""Any time off takes you a very, very long to come back,"" he said. ""But I'm excited, like I'm genuinely excited for the challenge. I feel almost refreshed. I feel like I've almost reset everything and I think the fear of failing has gone.  ""The nerves, at the moment, have gone. The weight on my shoulders has gone, I think because I got into the mindset of I'm done that I'm coming back. ""I've got new reasons. I'm doing it for Willow. I would love for everyone to come out to Paris, and have the opportunity to watch in Paris. ""To see where I can get to, see if I can make that history, if I can make a fourth Olympic Games. But just to almost prove to myself that I can do it and also to show a message to Willow to never give up. ""I think that's what's helped me move forward without that fear of failure which is powerful. If I carried on like that there would have been a point where it all crumbled and crumbled bad."" A goal of Whitlock's now is to help other athletes feeling the same way he did. ""This is a huge impact on me,"" he said. ""Massive. I couldn't believe it. Now I feel like I've almost come out the other side of it and seen benefits of even going through that stage.  ""I'd love to help athletes because it's so common. I would love to help people in general just to go through something like this. I'd love to see if there are ways where I can help people in that because going from myself, I struggled I think people [would] never think that I would go through that feeling.""

"Deborah James: You, Me and The Big C podcast wins top award","Sat, 23 Jul 2022 18:26:44 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-62236332,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-62236332?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"You, Me and The Big C and Dear Daughter are among the winners at this year's British Podcast Awards.","The podcast hosted by the late Dame Deborah James has been honoured at the British Podcast Awards. You, Me and the Big C, hosted by James, Lauren Mahon and the late Rachael Bland, focused on life with and the treatment of cancer. The Podcast Champion award is given to a person or show that has broken new ground, using its platform to help grow communities. When she died in June, Dame Deborah's Bowelbabe fund had raised over Â£7m. Her co-presenter Lauren Mahon accepted the award, saying: ""I don't think there are many podcasts that you could say would be standing up here whose co-hosts are not with them because they have died of the subject matter, but that is why we do what we do.   ""We knew it was a risk when we started it and it is something that we will continue to champion.""  Established in 2017, the British Podcast Awards celebrate the UK's best output, from well-known voices to underground hits, and includes entries from a wide range of creators and subjects including comedy and news.  This year's ceremony was hosted by BBC Radio 5 Live's Elis James and John Robins at Kennington Park in London. Previous winners have included Helen Zaltzman and Fearne Cotton, as well as 'My Dad Wrote A Porno'. This video can not be played Remembering Dame Deborah James: 'One of those special people' Diagnosed with stage three bowel cancer at the age of 35 in December 2016, Dame Deborah James said at the time that ""my entire world changed"". Signing off her final podcast in May of this year, she said: ""Check your poo. Come on. I can't leave on any other word apart from check your poo."" She died the following month at the age of 40 while receiving end-of-life care for bowel cancer at home, with a private funeral held by friends and family earlier this week. Known as Bowelbabe, she helped raise Â£7.4m for charity in her final weeks of life and received a damehood from Prince William in a ceremony at her parents' home.  BBC presenter and You, Me and the Big C host Rachael Bland died at the age of 40 in 2018, almost two years after being diagnosed with breast cancer. This video can not be played The #YouMeBigC team talk about the importance of their podcast and friendship in 2018 Elsewhere at this year's podcast awards, there was more success for Namulanta Kombo and her BBC World Service podcast 'Dear Daughter', which took home the podcast of the year prize, as well as the family award. Kombo won the BBC's International Podcast Competition in 2021 while living at home in Kenya. 'Dear Daughter' aims to provide life lessons and advice, created by letters from listeners. She said: ""Making the podcast has been a defining moment for me, I stepped out of my comfort zone and whole heartedly went for it. ""We created something special that resonates with people all over the world. We want to be heard and we want the best for the people we love. Winning Podcast of the Year is an incredible feeling and a huge honour."" By the end of this year it is estimated that podcasting will become a $1bn industry globally. Those behind the British awards hope to direct this growth towards a variety of projects - they have introduced a new climate award to celebrate output addressing environmental issues.  Matt Deegan, co-founder of the British Podcast Awards, said: ""We're working with the Feast Collective to champion great initiatives both behind and in front of the mic."" ""This isn't just about green podcasts that are preaching to the converted - although their work is important - but also the comedy, current affairs and fiction series that are addressing these issues at their audiences too."" The inaugural winner was 'Get Birding', aimed at budding birdwatchers and those who want to discover more about birds. There was also success for comedian James Acaster, with his weekly 'James Acaster's Perfect Sounds' picking up the arts and culture prize. Kirk Flash took home the rising star award for 'This is Gay', which examines darker aspects of modern gay life. Coiled, a podcast exploring Black Afro hair, won moment of the year, with host and producer Leanne Alie and assistant producer Sylvie Carlos collecting the award. Decode, which analyses the lyrics, beats, and social context of some of the most popular rap albums, won two awards.  The listeners' choice award - the only one voted for by the public - went to RedHanded, a true crime podcast hosted by Hannah Maguire and Suruthi Bala, who were previous winners.

Michael Sheen: I broke down hearing kids' care stories,"Tue, 05 Jul 2022 10:51:23 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-61954808,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-61954808?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Michael Sheen speaks to young people in care as part of a BBC investigation into the system.,"This video can not be played Actor Michael Sheen says the ""worst things imaginable"" are happening to children in care How would you feel if your child, or one you knew, was taken into care and ended up living in a B&B, a hostel, or even slept rough? What I'm talking about here is ""the care system"", the safety net we'd rely on if we couldn't look after our kids. I've been working on a BBC documentary which has found teenagers are still being placed in B&Bs and hostels - six years after the Welsh government said it wanted to ""eliminate"" it. Some of the stories have shocked me. With record numbers of children being taken into care in Wales and England, I've spoken to some young people who have been through the care system in an hour-long documentary, filmed over nearly three years, I've helped make for the BBC. My question is: does the care system always ""care"" for children who can't stay with mum or dad? ""I know for a fact prison would have been better than where I was placed,"" Niall told my BBC Wales Investigates 'Lifting the lid on the care system' documentary. He says he grew up moving in and out of care between the age of 14 and 18 - and after a place in a children's home broke down just as he turned 17, he was placed in a B&B. ""People moved there that had just come out of prison and stuff,"" Niall added. ""So I got robbed a couple of times in there. You'd see people kicking down doors on a daily basis, there'd be people smashing windows, people carrying knives."" Niall told me he was then moved into what he describes as a hostel, although his council insists it was supported housing as they tried to find him somewhere permanent to live. ""I was woken up by a punch basically,"" he recalled about one incident.  ""So I had to start barricading my door which, obviously, they got through eventually. It was like they put all the troubled teenagers under one roof."" The people in charge of Niall's care said they made every effort to find him somewhere else to stay and that his case was not straightforward, but Caerphilly council did not comment on the threats and violence. Hope was taken into care at 14 but ran away after her foster placement broke down when she was 16. This video can not be played The state took charge of Hope as she had been exploited by people in her community ""I was a child in a tent with an adult who was over the age of 18, sleeping rough, where nobody knew where I was,"" Hope, now in her early 20s, told me. ""I was technically a child of the state. It wasn't OK... I was at risk."" Those responsible for Hope's care said it could not comment on individual cases but Wrexham council said its services had been transformed and it would use Hope's comments to improve things further. In 2016, I presented a petition to the Welsh government to end the practice of children being placed in B&Bs and hostels. Ministers said they wanted to ""eliminate"" it - but six years on, it's still happening. Research by the BBC Wales Investigates team suggests dozens of teenagers like Niall and Hope are still being put in that position.  Freedom of information requests to all councils in Wales showed at least 50 young people were placed in B&Bs, hostels and budget hotels in the past financial year, with at least 285 in other accommodation which is not regulated by the care watchdog. I don't want this to come across as an attack on social workers - because it's not. It is their job to look after these young people but they're working within a system that is, according to one report last year by those in charge of social services, facing a ""crisis"" to find suitable places for children to stay. While most children placed in such temporary accommodation are 16 or 17, our investigation found a small number are even younger. One example included an 11-year-old being housed in temporary accommodation with council staff, because there was nowhere else for them to go. Gemma - not her real name - felt she was let down by the system that was supposed to keep her safe. She says she was exploited by older men when she was young before eventually being taken into care at 14, when she had become addicted to heroin. ""I'd moved house 12 times by the time I was 15,"" she said. ""I've never fully unpacked anywhere. Nobody ever keeps me very long anyway."" When she was 16 she was offered a hostel to stay in by social workers, which she said had a drug dealer staying there. ""I'd just spent nine months getting clean,"" Gemma said.  ""They then placed me in this hostel where he was anyway. I was there less than a week before I was back on drugs."" After meeting Gemma and hearing all she'd been through, I broke down because what she had experienced and what she told me was just devastating. No child should have to live that life. My personal view is that we shouldn't tolerate that some young people just disappear and the worst possible things imaginable happen to them. Children who, from the beginning and often through no choice of their own, find themselves in circumstances that already makes things harder for them than it does for anyone else. People in social care tell you those are the children who are most likely to end up homeless, most likely to end up with mental health issues, with alcohol and drug dependency issues and even being sexually abused. The group that represents Wales' 22 local authorities said councils in Wales were ""committed to doing their best in responding to the growing demands and increasingly complex challenges in children's social care"". The Welsh Local Government Association said it regretted the standard of care and support it wanted to achieve has not been met in everyone's case, and that it was keen to learn from young people's experiences. It also believes there is a need for additional funding to help children and families earlier, and that wider societal issues such as access to health services and ending child poverty are not things children's social care can solve alone. When I challenged Wales' deputy minister for social services on her government's record, she told me that while the majority of children in the care system grow up in loving families, she accepts that a minority of children do not have the experiences she would want them to have. ""What we really want to do is put as much support as we possibly can to parents and children at an earlier age, and stop so many numbers coming into care,"" said Julie Morgan MS.  ""Crises do happen, placements break down, families break down... and the children have to be put somewhere... we don't accept that that should be the situation and we're trying to do things to stop that."" She added there were plans for new specialist accommodation for children with complex needs across Wales and the government was investing more in foster care and providing support for those leaving care. ""We have got it at the top of our agenda here in Wales... which doesn't mean that things don't go wrong,"" Ms Morgan added. ""To hear these tales from young people - and that I've heard so many times - that break your heart, you think how could this have happened? ""I absolutely accept that, but we're doing our utmost to make sure that every young person in Wales has, you know, a happy fulfilling life."" In England and Scotland, there has just been an independent review of the children's care system which called for earlier help for families too. Those in charge of social services departments there have long called for a ""system overhaul"" to address all sorts of issues  The UK government said it had already banned under-16s staying in places that aren't inspected by the watchdog and will respond with more detailed plans later this year. But for everything the politicians are putting forward, based on what you'll see if you watch my BBC documentary, I wonder if you would be happy for the current care system to look after your child if you weren't around. If not, then don't we all need to consider whether that safety net - and the people who work within it - is being treated with the priority it deserves? Because if we continue to let these people down and continue to get this wrong, surely the consequences don't bear thinking about. Don't we feel we owe it to them - and society as whole - to sort this out?

What is the energy price cap and how high will bills go?,"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 14:50:36 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-58090533,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-58090533?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Energy bills are set to rise sharply in October, when a new price cap is introduced.","Energy bills will fall by more than 12% for most people in England, Scotland and Wales from April.  The latest price cap has been announced by energy regulator Ofgem, which sets the maximum price suppliers can charge households for each unit of gas and electricity they use. The energy price cap is set every three months and covers 29 million households in England, Wales and Scotland. It fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit. Gas prices will be capped at 6p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 24p per kWh. Currently, gas is 7.42p per kWh and electricity 28.62p per kWh. When prices soared after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, the government introduced a temporary Energy Price Guarantee to limit bills. However, Ofgem is again responsible for deciding how much customers can be charged. The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. Prices are also falling there. Ofgem says that, from April, an average household paying by direct debit for dual fuel (gas and electricity) will pay Â£1,690 a year, a drop of Â£238 from the previous cap. The fall in energy prices has raised hopes that suppliers will offer cheaper, fixed-price deals. These offer certainty for a set period, but if prices drop further people can find themselves stuck at the higher price. Analysts at Cornwall Insight predict the price cap will see a small fall in July, but increase slightly in October. When considering a fixed-price deal, Ofgem says people should seek independent advice and ""consider what is most important for them, whether that's the lowest price or the security of a fixed deal"". Price comparison website Uswitch says it expects ""increased competition"" from suppliers, but warns that people to check any exit fees if they want to leave a fixed deal early. Although the overall cap has fallen, standing charges - a fixed daily amount which covers the costs of connecting to a supply - have increased. Standing charges will be 60p a day for electricity and 31p a day for gas, although they vary by region. The regulator will also add Â£28 to everyone's bill over a year to cover the cost of dealing with Â£3.1bn of debt that customers owe to suppliers. How much you pay for energy depends on the overall amount of gas and electricity you use.  But the type of property you live in, how energy efficient it is, and how many people live there, also affect your bill. The Ofgem cap is based on a ""typical household"" using 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year and paying by direct debit. The vast majority of people pay their bill this way, to help spread payments across the year. Those who pay every three months by cash and cheque are charged more. Their typical annual bill from April will be Â£1,796, which is Â£106 more a year than that of a direct debit customer. Households on prepayment meters will now pay the same as those on direct debit. Previously they were charged more. About four million households had prepayment meters in July 2023, according to Ofgem.  Many have been in place for years, but some meters were installed more recently after customers struggled to pay their bills.  New rules mean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts before switching them to a meter, and they cannot be installed at all in certain households. Certain groups - such as pensioners and those on some means-tested or disability benefits - received extra cost-of-living payments when bills soared.  But much of that extra support has now finished.  The Â£500m Household Support Fund, which the government introduced to help with costs in September 2021, had been due to end in March 2024.  However, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced a six-month extension in the April Budget.  The Warm Home Discount scheme continues to offer a discount to eligible pensioners and low income households.  The government's Fuel Direct Scheme can help people to repay a debt from their benefit payments.  In addition, energy suppliers must offer customers affordable payment plans or repayment holidays if they are struggling to pay bills. Most suppliers also offer hardship grants. The energy support scheme for businesses, which offered firms a discount on wholesale prices, will end in March 2024. The scheme offered a larger discount to heavy energy-using sectors, like glass, ceramics and steelmakers.

Boris Johnson resignation: Did the outgoing prime minister meet his pledges?,"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 10:41:30 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-58401767,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-58401767?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson made promises on Brexit,, taxes, health and police - did he deliver on them?","During his last week in office, Boris Johnson talked about his record in government - highlighting policies on police recruitment and broadband. He became prime minister and won a landslide victory in 2019 and made a series of pledges to voters. Delivering on them was made harder by the Covid pandemic, but how did he get on?  The Conservatives promised this for England and Wales by March 2023. Latest figures, up to 30 June 2022, show an extra 13,790 police officers recruited. That means the government is two-thirds of the way there with one year to go. But that rise still hasn't made up for police numbers falling by 20,545 between March 2010 and March 2019 - under Conservative-led governments. The Conservatives promised this for England by March 2025.  Latest figures show 319,846 full-time equivalent NHS nurses and health visitors in May 2022. That is up 23,753 since December 2019, leaving 26,247 posts to fill. On GPs, there were 35,257 full-time equivalents in post in July 2022. That's up by just 738 since the end of December 2019. If you exclude locums (doctors who temporarily fill a rota gap) and trainees, GP numbers have actually decreased by 314 since December 2019. In November 2021, the then Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""I'm not going to pretend we're on track when we're not."" This 2019 pledge was to be met ""over the next 10 years"".  In August 2021, the government came up with several definitions for what it said constituted a ""new"" hospital:  In December 2021, analysis by BBC Reality Check , found that of the 40 hospital projects announced by the government: When asked for an update, on 7 June 2022, a Department of Health spokesperson told us that one of the 40 hospitals ""opened for patients last year and a further six are in construction"".  This manifesto pledge was to be met by ""the mid-2020s"". In 2019-20, there were 242,700 net additional dwellings, which fell to 216,490 in 2020-21. Net additional dwellings includes houses converted to flats, commercial buildings switching to domestic use, as well as new builds. It also factors in demolished houses. The prime minister was asked about the pledge on 9 June 2022 and said: ""I can't give you a cast iron guarantee that we're going to get to a number in a particular year."" This was achieved in a literal sense as the UK left the EU on 31 January 2020.  Britain departed from the EU's single market and customs union 11 months later, after agreeing a basic free trade deal with the EU. But if this election slogan implied Brexit would be done and dusted, this has clearly not happened. A huge amount remains unresolved, from Northern Ireland to financial services. A large number of trade deals have been signed around the world (most to replace the ones the UK already had as an EU member) but a deal with the US hasn't happened. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which makes economic judgements for the government, predicts that leaving the EU will reduce the UK's imports and exports by about 15% in the long term, with about a 4% hit to productivity. Supporters of Brexit say sovereignty has been restored, and unwanted regulations can now be cut.  This was not possible while the UK was in the EU because of rules giving citizens the freedom to live and work in all EU countries. After Brexit, the government did launch this system. EU citizens wishing to live and work in the UK now have to apply for a visa via a points-based system (PBS), the same as citizens from the rest of the world.  The process has not been all plain sailing. Leaving the EU single market is one of the factors that contributed to an HGV driver shortage, because EU drivers can no longer come and go as they please. The government had to introduce 5,000 temporary visas for this sector.  This manifesto pledge was broken. In September 2021, the government announced that workers, the self-employed and employers would pay 1.25p more National Insurance (NI) in the pound from April 2022.  But, because of cost of living pressures, the government later reduced the impact of this by announcing that from 6 July 2022 the point at which employees would start paying NI would increase to Â£12,570.  This means that in the 12 months from April 2022, anyone earning less than about Â£34,000 will pay less NI than they did last year. Anybody earning more than that will pay more. The government says the money from the NI rise will go initially towards easing pressure on the NHS. A proportion will then be moved into the social care system - which Mr Johnson pledged, in 2019, to ""fix"".  In 2021, the government unveiled its plan to cap the costs that people in England pay for social care. From October 2023, this will be set at a maximum of Â£86,000 for care during their lifetime.  But the long-awaited reform of funding does not fix other problems such as the shortage of care workers. Research in May 2022 estimated that 500,000 adults in England were waiting for social care, up from 294,000 a year ago. The triple lock means the state pension increases each year at whichever of these is highest:  The 2019 Conservative manifesto said it would stay for the duration of this Parliament. But this promise was broken on 7 September 2021 when the government announced it was suspending the triple lock for a year and blamed the pandemic. The government says it will return in April 2023. This manifesto pledge has also been broken.  The UK's annual aid budget has been reduced to 0.5% of GNI (gross national income) - a cut of about Â£4bn. Again, the government blamed the pandemic - saying cutting aid spending would help restore the public finances. It said the 2015 legislation, which introduced the 0.7% target, referred to ""fiscal circumstances"" which governments may refer to, if they fail to meet it. This 2019 manifesto pledge was scaled back the following year.  In a policy paper released by HM Treasury in November 2020, the target had changed to ""a minimum of 85% gigabit capable coverage by 2025"".  There has been considerable progress though. Gigabit coverage has gone from 10% to 70% since July 2019, according to government figures.  As well as pledges, Boris Johnson has made claims about his government's record during the pandemic. The UK was the first country to approve a Covid vaccine - on 2 December 2020. Its vaccine rollout began on 8 December 2020 - weeks before the EU's.  The UK vaccine programme was the fastest in Europe until May 2021. After that, EU countries caught up, if you look at doses per 100 people in a country's population. The prime minister has repeatedly talked about the UK having the fastest-growing economy in the G7, which is a club of major, developed economies. Whether this is true depends on which period you are looking at. Update: This piece was first published on 4 October 2021 and has been updated several times since then to add pledges and update figures.

‘Newcastle starting to upset the big boys’ - Alan Shearer on Magpies' top-four hopes & win at Spurs,"Sun, 23 Oct 2022 21:13:47 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63366602,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63366602?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Match of the Day pundit Alan Shearer was not expecting his old side Newcastle to be in the Premier League top four after 12 games but says their results show they mean business.," Last updated on 23 October 202223 October 2022.From the section Newcastle I really didn't expect Newcastle to be in the top four after 12 games and, although I'd love to be proved wrong, I don't think they will still be there come the end of the season. But, while I am being realistic about their chances of making the Champions League places, I am still enjoying seeing Eddie Howe's side up there, playing so well, and getting big results like they did at Tottenham on Sunday. Their 2-1 win was another example of how Newcastle are starting to upset some of the big boys - and they don't like it. It was a similar story when they went to Anfield in August. They were beaten in the end, by a 98th-minute winner, but they were really unlucky to lose and Liverpool were moaning and groaning about how they had, almost, seen the game out. It's a good sign, because it shows Newcastle are no longer a soft touch wherever they go - something Manchester United also found out at Old Trafford last week. People know things are different now. They know Newcastle are coming, and they know they mean business.  Other than the first 15 minutes against Spurs, I thought Newcastle were the better team and they deserved their win. Tottenham looked quite average and one-dimensional in comparison, while Newcastle had plenty of ideas when they came forward. It was always going to be tough for them once Spurs pulled a goal back so early in the second half, but this Newcastle team has got a bit of steel about them, and they never panicked at any stage. The big thing for me when I watch them is how fit they look when they press, and how well organised they are.  They know when and how to press as a team, and it looks like they understand each other's game so they can work together - for the whole 90-plus minutes. To a man, they were superb defensively to keep Spurs chances to a minimum. I know Kieran Trippier got caught out by Harry Kane for their goal but, other than that, the Newcastle back four did not really put a foot wrong when Spurs attacked in the second half. Behind them, Nick Pope made two really good saves early on, but wasn't really tested after that. Pope has been a fantastic signing, not just because of his superb shot-stopping but also because of how bright and alert he is at all times, sweeping up when balls are played over the top of his defence. That was his main job after the break against Spurs, but he was always on his toes and you are never going to be nervous with him behind you. Part of the reason Newcastle are in fourth place in the Premier League is their defensive record - they have conceded fewer than any other side in the top flight - but it's fair to say they have surprised people at the other end of the pitch too. Miguel Almiron got another superb goal against Spurs, and the improvement from him this season has been incredible. The one thing that has never been in doubt since he joined Newcastle in 2019 is his work-rate - he has always put the effort in, and more. What has changed is that he has added an end product, not only with his goals but also his balls into the box. Almiron looks a real player now - intelligent, really quick, sharp on the ball and able to go past people.  From where he was when he was arrived to where he is now is an amazing transformation. It is the same with Joelinton, and credit for that has to go to the manager. Howe has improved the players who were already there when he took over in November last year, but he has obviously signed some better ones too.  In fact, every player he has brought in over the past couple of transfer windows has been a good signing and improved the team. That is very rare for any club, especially when you consider how many players have arrived at Newcastle in that time, but they have all made a positive impact in some way. Three of the back four against Spurs - Sven Botman, Dan Burn and Trippier - are Howe signings, along with Pope in goal, and they have all made the team more solid, with a better defensive understanding. In midfield, Bruno Guimaraes has been so good, he could get into any team in the Premier League on his current form. Up front, Chris Wood is mainly used off the bench now but he played a hugely important role in getting the club out of relegation trouble after joining last season. We've not seen enough of Alexander Isak yet because of his injury but I never had any doubt that Callum Wilson would do well when he played. Wilson's problem is his fitness, which is really unfortunate because if he didn't pick up injuries the way he has done throughout his career, he would probably be on the plane to Qatar for the World Cup. He's a goalscorer, who is always thinking about finding the net - like against Spurs, when he was given an unexpected chance after Hugo Lloris collided with him, but knew exactly what to do. Wilson is a threat in the box, and with his runs in behind. He is tough to play against and, with him in the side, goals are not going to be a problem for this Newcastle team either.

"Cold, hungry migrants stranded in London after error","Wed, 02 Nov 2022 20:38:54 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-63489901,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-63489901?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"The group were moved out of an overcrowded facility in Kent but given nowhere to stay, the BBC is told.","A group of migrants was mistakenly taken from Kent and stranded in central London, cold, hungry and without accommodation, the BBC has been told. About 40 migrants were removed from Manston, the overcrowded processing centre, on Tuesday so they could stay with friends and family in the capital, a homeless charity volunteer said. But 11 of them had nowhere to go after reaching Victoria railway station.    The Home Office said the group had told officials they had a place to stay. A spokesperson said when it was discovered that was not the case, they had worked ""at pace"" to find accommodation for them. The government has faced criticism after reports that Manston was holding migrants, including families, for four weeks, in breach of the law. It is intended that people stay for no more than 24 hours while their claim is processed.  At most, 1,600 migrants should be at the processing centre at any one time - the MP for the area said that figure was more like 4,000 on Monday. Home Secretary Suella Braverman is visiting the centre in Dover on Thursday.  The BBC has spoken to one migrant who says he was left stranded at Victoria station on Tuesday night.  John - not his real name - said he spent 21 days at Manston, sleeping on a mattress in a tent with about 150 people.  He referred to the processing centre as a ""detention centre"" and said he had no phone and no access to the outside world.  John thought he was being sent to a hotel in London when he boarded the coach from Manston on Tuesday afternoon. It was once he was told to get off the coach at Victoria station that he realised he would not be going to a hotel.  ""When we got to Victoria station the bus driver told us to get off the bus. I asked the bus driver to please call the immigration officer, but he said that I must get off the bus and call family. I said to him maybe there was misunderstanding because I don't have family in here. ""Other guys saying same. We were about 11 who didn't have anywhere to go. The bus driver just said we had to get off the bus. He said he just had to take us to Victoria and we should use phones to call family. ""At Victoria station I didn't know what to do. Other guys went to their families but where should I go?"" John, who did not want to say where he was from, explained a ""charity guy"" happened to be at the station, and saw the situation unfold. Danial Abbas, who was volunteering with the Under One Sky charity that evening, spotted the group. He told the BBC he saw a group of confused and disorientated men at Victoria station trying to flag down members of the public and staff. The men, who he understood to be from Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq, were all wearing identity bracelets with QR codes on their wrists. They appeared to have been issued by the Home Office, Mr Abbas said.  Mr Abbas said ""half of them didn't even have a jacket or proper shoes on"" and some were wearing flip flops. ""All their personal belongings were in blue plastic bags,"" he said. They were hungry and without any money, ""desperate for tea, coffee, soup"", Mr Abbas said. He arranged to buy food at McDonald's and bought more than 80 items of clothing for the group from Primark - including gloves, shoes, hats and pants.  ""They thought they were going to a hotel in London and were very happy about the prospect of leaving Manston,"" said Mr Abbas. There have been four cases of diphtheria - a highly contagious bacterial infection - reported at the processing centre. Mr Abbas sought assistance from charity Migrant Help. He said he was then able to get in touch with an official from the Home Office and that they had described the situation as ""completely unacceptable"". The group was eventually picked up at about 01:00 GMT on Wednesday and taken to a hotel in Norwich, he said. Mr Abbas told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme he went to the hotel on Wednesday night to drop off supplies, adding there were ""a lot of refugees staying at that particular hotel"".  ""We were almost glad that we were there at the right place at the right time to provide them with care, love and compassion that we did and they were in a safe place by the end of the night,"" Mr Abbas told the programme. Mr Abbas also said some of the group had blisters on their hands and feet, with one person in ""so much pain that had could only either stand up or walk - he couldn't sit or lie down properly"".  A Home Office spokesperson said: ""The welfare of those in our care is of the utmost importance and asylum seekers are only released from Manston when we have assurances that they have accommodation to go to. Any suggestion otherwise is wrong.  ""We worked at pace to find accommodation for the individuals as soon as we were notified, and they are now being supported."" The British Transport Police said officers arrived at the station just after 22:30 on Tuesday, responding to reports of asylum seekers looking for assistance.  ""Officers engaged and liaised with charity partners, rail staff, and government colleagues to help them find accommodation for the evening,"" a spokesperson said.  They said no criminal offence was committed.  Migrant Help, which is a charity appointed by the Home Office to provide asylum seekers with advice and help with problems, said they would not comment on individual cases. But it said it was concerning and ""if this was indeed the case then, of course, our sympathies go to the people who have been put into this situation through no fault of their own"".

Ukraine war round-up: Carnage at the river and a war crimes trial,"Fri, 13 May 2022 19:59:05 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61440608,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61440608?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,A single Russian battalion reportedly suffers heavy losses and the UK sanctions President Putin's ex-wife.,"The toll of the fighting on both Ukraine's health sector and Russia's invading army made sobering reading on the 79th day of the war. Russian forces were accused by Ukrainian MPs of completely destroying more than 100 healthcare facilities since the invasion started on 24 February. British military intelligence said a single Russian battalion had recently lost almost all of its armoured vehicles during a failed attempt to cross a river in the eastern war zone. Aerial images showed dozens of burnt-out tanks and the remains of a pontoon bridge. BBC News Russian has been able to verify the deaths of 2,336 Russian service personnel since the start of the invasion.  Moscow's forces made gains elsewhere, reportedly taking the strategically important town of Rubizne.    In Kyiv, Ukraine started its first war crimes trial since the beginning of the invasion, putting a 21-year-old Russian soldier in the dock and accusing him of killing an unarmed civilian. Western sanctions on Russia got more personal when the UK placed travel bans and asset freezes on Russian President Vladimir Putin's former wife, Lyudmila Ocheretnaya, and his alleged current girlfriend, Alina Kabaeva. And a Russian energy supplier said it would suspend deliveries of electricity to Finland from Saturday, one day after the Finnish president said he supported an application for Nato membership. An estimated 14 million Ukrainians have fled their homes since the invasion started. One of the six million or so who moved abroad is nine-year-old Marharyta, who spoke no English when she first arrived in the UK from her home city of Lviv. She and her mum Larysa moved to Manchester after securing visas through the Ukraine Family Scheme, and now she is happily learning the new language. This video can not be played Ukrainian refugee Marharyta, nine, is learning English as she waits to start school in Manchester The UK government has plans to enrol up to 100,000 Ukrainian children who have fled the war. The National Association of Head Teachers is calling for urgent counselling support and access to specialist language tuition. India has not joined in the international condemnation of Russia's invasion, making clear it does not want to take sides. However, some defence experts believe it may find it has little choice other than to lessen its dependence on Russian military equipment, given the impact of Western sanctions. In the last decade, it has bought more equipment from other countries - noticeably from France, but also from Israel and the US and, to a lesser extent, the UK. But Sangeeta Saxena, editor of Delhi-based Aviation and Defence Universe, says the Indian army will keep buying from Russia - not just because its personnel are familiar with the equipment, but also because the relationship with Russia has withstood the test of time. The invasion has tightened global supplies of the metal, pushing up the price, which had already climbed during the coronavirus pandemic. ""A lot of buyers of aluminium in Europe are almost self-sanctioning and refusing to touch Russian aluminium if they can,"" says Uday Patel, senior research manager at consultancy Wood Mackenzie. The metal is used in a bewildering variety of products, from door frames to aircraft, and some believe supply constraints are likely to continue for some time.  Read on.

John Shuttleworth cave concert abandoned due to cliff rescue,"Fri, 20 May 2022 12:08:40 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-61511494,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-61511494?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"A walker got lost, slipped and was left clinging to a tree 100ft (30m) above the cave entrance.","A concert at a Peak District cavern had to be abandoned due to the rescue of a man dangling from a ledge above it. Comedian John Shuttleworth was halfway through the show at Peak Cavern, known as the ""Devil's Arse"", at Castleton on Thursday when the alarm was raised. It emerged a walker trying to get to the event had got lost, slipped and had been left clinging to a tree 100ft (30m) above the cave entrance. Edale Mountain Rescue got him to safety and he suffered only cuts and bruises. The rescue team said it was called out at 20:55 BST and found the man had followed his sat-nav while walking from his overnight accommodation to the cavern.  ""However, somehow he managed to end up on a footpath above the cavern. ""He came into extreme difficulties and slipped, just managing to catch a tree to arrest his fall, inches from a 100ft drop to the cavern floor. ""Unfortunately the concert had to be cancelled, and people had to be evacuated from the area due to the danger of rocks being dislodged on to the concertgoers below,"" they said. A member of the rescue team was lowered to the man and then both were lifted to safety. After a check-up, he was given a lift back to his accommodation by a team member. John Shuttleworth - real name Graham Fellows - tweeted to confirm the man was safe and well, adding: ""We wish him well, and to my lovely Peak Cavern audience - thank you for evacuating so swiftly, and see you soon for the 2nd half!"" In a later tweet, he said: ""I suppose I'll have to write a song about the incident now. I can perform it when I return to finish the abandoned gig.""

Rudy Giuliani is target of Georgia election investigation,"Mon, 15 Aug 2022 23:40:33 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-62557849,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-62557849?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"The ex-New York mayor, due to testify this week, dismissed the inquiry as politically motivated.","Donald Trump's former personal lawyer has revealed he is the target of a criminal inquiry in Georgia into alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 White House election results. Ex-New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who is due to testify this week at court in Atlanta, dismissed the investigation as politically motivated. Mr Giuliani led legal challenges to dispute the outcome of the election. He also amplified Mr Trump's baseless claims about alleged voter fraud. As the former president's election lawyer in December 2020, Mr Giuliani repeatedly made unfounded allegations about stolen ballots as he urged state lawmakers in Georgia not to certify President Joe Biden's election victory. On Monday, Mr Giuliani's attorney Robert Costello told US media that prosecutors had informed their legal team that the former mayor was under investigation. But Mr Giuliani will refuse to answer any questions about Mr Trump that might breach attorney-client privilege when he testifies in court on Wednesday, Mr Costello said. On a radio talk show in New York on Monday, Mr Giuliani said Atlanta was one of ""the most crooked cities in the country"" and it was a ""Democratic dictatorship"". Mr Biden, a Democrat, beat Mr Trump, a Republican, by 12,670 votes in Georgia, according to audited results. Fulton County, where the investigation is based, launched its criminal inquiry after a recording surfaced from a January 2021 phone call in which Mr Trump was heard urging the state's top election official, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, to ""find"" enough votes to alter the outcome. A prosecutor convened a grand jury in May to hear evidence. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has said her investigation could result in racketeering or conspiracy charges. But just because Mr Giuliani has been asked to testify it does not mean that he or anyone else will be charged with a crime.  Ms Willis has said she is also considering calling Mr Trump to testify before the grand jury. On Monday, a federal judge rejected efforts by US Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina to avoid testifying to the Fulton County grand jury. The inquiry is also looking into a ""fake electors"" plan, under which Georgia Republicans allegedly signed phony certificates declaring that Mr Trump had won the 2020 presidential election. Mr Trump is himself under congressional investigation for his activities surrounding last year's US Capitol riot and his attempts to challenge Mr Biden's election victory. He is also being investigated under the Espionage Act after federal authorities said they found classified files in a raid last week of his Florida estate, according to a search warrant.

More people playing golf in Scotland than before pandemic,"Thu, 19 May 2022 21:51:14 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-61491324,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-61491324?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"When lockdowns halted most other sports, more people took up golf - and many are still playing.","Jodie Stalker took up golf for something to do outdoors during the pandemic because she could no longer play netball indoors. The 27-year-old said her new hobby was due to the frustration at her usual routine being disrupted. Her story is not uncommon, as recent data has suggested there are now more people playing golf in Scotland than before the pandemic. There are now more than 200,000 golfers registered across the country. Golf is one of Scotland's most famous exports.  In July, The Open Championship will be held at the sport's birthplace at St Andrews.  The oldest major marks its 150th tournament this year, returning to the fabled Old Course for the first time in seven years.  Recent data from Scottish Golf and the R&A - the organisation that governs golf worldwide - found that 5.3 million adult golfers played nine or 18 holes in Great Britain and Ireland in 2020.  The latest figures for 2021 show the figure dropped to 4.8 million, still considerably higher than the 3 million recorded in 2019, prior to the pandemic.  It is thought much of the surge in players has been down to the sport's ability to be played safely outdoors while other sports including football and rugby were subject to Covid restrictions.  Teaching assistant Ms Stalker, from Ellon in Aberdeenshire, took up the game early last year.  ""I couldn't go to netball - golf was something I could go and do instead,"" she told BBC Scotland.  ""It was outdoors and you didn't have the fear of catching Covid or taking Covid back to my family. ""It was a bit daunting as there's a lot of golf etiquette - you're just this numpty on the golf course that's hitting your ball into the long grass. ""But everyone has been very supportive and now I'd go to any golf club and play."" Karin Sharp, chief operating officer of Scottish Golf, described the situation as ""hugely encouraging"". She said: ""There's no secret that over the last 10 years membership numbers across the game in Scotland have been in decline.  ""However, 2020 saw an uplift of just under 7% and last year saw a further uplift of more than 7%.  ""We now have a total playing membership of 208,000 golfers registered across Scotland and that's the highest its been since 2012. It's great to see and hopefully it can be sustained moving forward. ""It's now on us as a sport to ensure that the people who have come back into golf taken up golf in the past couple of years, that we work with clubs to keep those players engaged in the game."" It has been a real shot in the arm for Scotland's 550 golf courses.  Inverurie Golf Club in Aberdeenshire has seen an increase of more than 100 members during the pandemic to 760.  Ashley Wilson, the club manager, said: ""Demand for golf increased significantly. We actually had to curtail our members and enforce a restriction of three rounds per week per member because the demand was that significant."" Much of the success at Inverurie has been down to its junior programme.  Before the pandemic, there were only two junior members at the club and now more than 100 young players attend weekly training sessions, run by dozens of qualified coaches and volunteers.  ""It's the future of the club,"" said Ben Zanre, the junior convenor.  ""I think mums and dads after the strictest restrictions were lifted wanted to get their kids doing activities outside  ""I think there's a perception that golf isn't accessible to all. However, I think it's as accessible as it ever has been and golf clubs across Scotland are crying out for juniors."" Now that life has largely returned to normal, competition has once again ramped up to secure people's time.  However, it is hoped major competitions such as The Open being held in Scotland will encourage even more people to take up an interest in the sport.

Possible Mull Viking boat burials to be investigated,"Wed, 07 Sep 2022 09:17:22 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-62794761,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-62794761?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Archaeologists will evaluate two mounds on Mull as part of a series of digs later this month.,"Archaeologists are preparing to investigate two possible Viking boat burial sites on the Isle of Mull. Two elongated mounds on the Hebridean island are to be evaluated as part of a series of digs later this month. Boat burials involved high-ranking Vikings being interred with a ship, and in Scotland a site was previously found and excavated in Ardnamurchan. On Mull, archaeologists will check to see whether the mounds near Lephin are natural features or burial sites. The investigation will involve archaeologists and volunteers digging small trenches by hand. The Mull Museum and Argyll Archaeology project, which will be led by archaeologist Dr Clare Ellis, also hopes to unearth Viking and Norse artefacts and structures at Lephin. Dr Ellis said the Ardnamurchan boat burial was the most southerly known site of its kind in Scotland. She said: ""It would be exciting if this was not a one off and was happening regularly around the coast."" If one, or both, of the mounds were found to be a burial site, more funding would be sought to plan and carry out a full or partial excavation of a mound. Viking and Norse finds were made in digs at the location in 2018 and 2019. Previous discoveries have included evidence of an early settlement with a turf and timber structure. Fragments of a late 10th or 11th Century decorated antler comb and cover, similar to ones found at Norse period sites in Orkney and throughout Scandinavia, were also found. Archaeologists said during the late 12th and first half of the 13th Century there was a thriving farm at Lephin. Middens, or rubbish dumps, were found at the site and contained burnt grains, metal objects and fragments of pottery. Dr Ellis said it would be interesting to discover whether descendants of Vikings arriving on Mull in the 8th and 9th centuries continued to live and farm on the island in the Norse period of around the 10th and 11th centuries. In 2011, archaeologists revealed the discovery of a rare, intact Viking boat burial in Ardnamurchan in the west Highlands. Artefacts buried alongside the Viking in his boat suggested he was a high-ranking warrior. The finds included a sword, spearhead and 213 of the boat's rivets. Other Viking and Norse discoveries made in Scotland have included a 12th Century shipyard on Skye and a suspected drinking hall in Orkney.

Mountain gorillas: The ripple effect of conservation,"Sun, 19 Jun 2022 23:31:32 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-61788828,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-61788828?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Justin Rowlatt finds out what gorilla conservation can teach us about protecting other species.,"BBC climate editor Justin Rowlatt visits Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, Uganda, to find out what mountain gorilla conservation can tell us about protecting other species. I could tell she knew I was there. But the burly matriarch of the Nshongi mountain gorilla family was ignoring me as she plucked branches from a bush and lazily munched on the leaves, like a teenager working her way through a packet of crisps.   Then suddenly a baby gorilla tumbled through the undergrowth and past us both. She looked across and our eyes met. Instinctively I lowered my gaze. She wasn't hostile, she just wanted to make sure I knew my place. What was surprising was that I understood exactly what her glance meant. And, even more astonishing, I knew she understood me too. It is that visceral sense of connection between species which makes visiting mountain gorillas in the wild such a profound experience. Spend just a few minutes in the company of a family of gorillas and the concept of ""us and them"" dissolves. You meet as equals. This video can not be played Justin meets the Nshongi mountain gorilla family Yet until fairly recently, the world's mountain gorillas appeared to be on an inexorable path to extinction. Sir David Attenborough recently described how his famous encounter with a mountain gorilla family in 1979 had been ""tinged with sadness"". It was one of the most memorable experiences of his life, he said, but he worried he might be meeting ""the last of their kind"". Sir David understands that extinction is part of the evolutionary process - some species die away as others evolve. The problem is species are currently becoming extinct far more rapidly than is usual in evolutionary history. Scientists estimate species extinction is happening at least 100 times more than the normal ""background rate"". Many believe we are in the middle of a global cull of species comparable in scale to the five previous events in the geological record during which a large proportion of life on earth went extinct. This matters because biodiversity underpins so much of the functioning of the natural world - from the food we eat to the air we breathe and the water we drink. It also helps protect us from pollution, floods and climate breakdown. This video can not be played David Attenborough encounters a family of mountain gorillas But UN negotiations to stem the tide of extinction in Geneva earlier this year ended in deadlock. This week delegates meet in Nairobi to try to reboot the talks. The aim is to agree 21 targets, including protecting at least 30% of the world's land and seas by 2030. The hope is to provide a framework for a landmark international agreement under the UN Convention on Biological Diversity that will be signed by governments in Kunming in October. The ultimate goal could hardly be more lofty - for humanity to ""live in harmony with nature"" by 2050. Mountain Gorillas: A Conservation Success We talk a lot about the climate crisis, but much less about the biodiversity crisis. Justin Rowlatt asks what the success of mountain gorilla conservation tells us about protecting other species.  Watch on BBC iPlayer now. So, does the fate of the mountain gorilla hold lessons for how we can conserve threatened species? When Sir David visited the family of gorillas there were around 600 mountain gorillas left. The species was listed as ""critically endangered"". Mountain gorillas cannot survive in captivity so protection in the wild was their only hope. They live in two groups. One in the Virunga Forest, which straddles the borders between Uganda, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the other in the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest in Uganda. They faced the same challenges as many threatened species do today - the habitat they live in was rapidly being cleared by farmers, conservation efforts were being hampered by conflict, and they were sometimes killed by poachers. But 40 years later, the population is now more than 1,000-strong and growing. The species is now listed as just ""endangered"" - a significant improvement. In fact, there has been something of a baby boom in the past couple of years. Five mountain gorilla infants were born in Bwindi in late 2020 - an unprecedented number. Just three were born in the whole of 2019.  The secret of this success? Dr Gladys Kalema Zikusoka was the Uganda Wildlife Authority's first vet in 1995, then she set up the charity Conservation Through Public Health. Perhaps surprisingly, she says, carefully managed tourism has been crucial. ""Tourism really does help wild animals if it is done right."" But only, she clarifies, if the income from tourism really does flow into the local community.  A gorilla encounter figures high on many bucket lists, and tourist lodges and rest houses, craft stalls and trekking centres, now encircle the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest national park. ""When I first started out there were only about five lodges, now there are as many as 70,"" says Dr Gladys. ""The lodges have created jobs, the NGOs have created jobs."" Gorilla tourism has boosted the entire regional economy, she says, and now the revenues it generates covers much of the cost of running Uganda's wildlife protection service. Bwindi's chief warden, Nelson Guma, agrees the income from tourism has been crucial because it underpins the support of the local community. ""These communities live next to the park. And so we feel that they should be a part of the conservation, and they should get benefits from conservation."" Visiting a gorilla family is not cheap. You pay $600 per person, Uganda's gorillas receive up to 40,000 visits a year. Local communities get a 20% cut of the revenue from the park. And mountain gorilla conservation has another huge benefit. To protect the gorillas you need to protect the entire forest ecosystem. The Bwindi Impenetrable Forest is one of the most biodiverse places on earth, so thousands - possibly tens of thousands - of other species are conserved as well.  What's more, the cash the gorillas help earn has been used to neutralise other threats. Mountain gorillas used occasionally to be caught in the traps poachers set to catch deer, wild pigs and other animals. They would either sell their catch as bush meat or use it to help feed their families.  But once the gorillas became a lucrative tourist attraction, the authorities could afford to make poachers an offer that was hard to refuse - get caught hunting in the park and you'll go to jail, they were told. Stay out and we'll find work for you either in the park or on land provided by charities. ""Now we are the ambassadors of the park,"" says Vincent Nshmarairw proudly. He's a former poacher who works for an agricultural project funded by the UK-based Gorilla Organisation charity.  Mr Nshmarairw hopes gorillas will be the key to his family's future prosperity. ""My children are all at school,"" he tells me. ""And with time maybe they can get jobs from the park."" Tourism is not without problems. Tourists can disturb animals and disrupt their natural behaviour, it generates pollution and waste, and can undermine local cultures. But most of the world's major conservation organisations, including the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Conservation International and the World Wildlife Fund, now support carefully managed ecotourism as a useful conservation tool.  Tourism is also rarely a complete solution. Despite their economic heft, the mountain gorilla population remains vulnerable. The national parks that the two mountain gorilla populations live in are large, but they represent a tiny fraction of the vast jungle that used to cover the region and, as the gorilla population grows, space is becoming an issue. ""We're definitely seeing that gorilla families are more crowded,"" says Tara Stoinski who runs the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund. Gorillas are ""bumping into each other more"", warns Ms Stoinski. These encounters are associated with aggression and fights, sometimes with tragic consequences: ""We're seeing higher rates of infanticide. Infants can oftentimes be killed when these families come together.""  Research by the Gorilla Fund suggests that, in some areas of the Virunga Forest, the growth in the gorilla population is slowing for the first time in decades.  ""We would love to see this population grow but in order to do so, there's really going to need to be more habitat available to them,"" says Ms Stoinski. The answer would be more land set aside for the gorillas - exactly what the UN says needs to happen worldwide. But taking productive land out of action costs money and the developing world says they need financial support to do it. This is one of the main sticking points in negotiations. Developing countries are demanding the developed world pay them $100bn a year to support conservation. The success of mountain gorilla conservation shows we can save species from the brink of extinction, says the UN's head of biodiversity, Elizabeth Mrema. She is confident the delegates in Nairobi will be able to find compromises when they meet this week.  The question for the world is how much energy and resources we are willing to put into the effort to protect biodiversity. Ms Mrema issues a stark warning: ""We've been told by scientists we only have this century to solve the biodiversity crisis. There is no planet B,"" she says.

David Nott: The war surgeon helping doctors save lives in Ukraine,"Sat, 23 Apr 2022 23:39:24 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61195923,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61195923?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,David Nott worked in conflict zones around the world - now he's sharing his expertise to help doctors in Ukraine.,"On Thursday, trauma surgeon David Nott was in London - a long way from Ukraine. But that didn't stop him from helping to save the leg of a man who'd been caught by a blast in the war-ravaged country. Oleksandr, the doctor who actually carried out the operation, had never performed the tricky procedure before. But a little over a week previously he had watched Prof Nott demonstrate how it was done inside a Ukrainian hospital. And so Oleksandr took a photo of the wound with his smartphone and sent it to Prof Nott, who had recently flown back to the UK. The experienced British war surgeon confirmed the operation was necessary. He'd also previously given Oleksandr a video talking him through how it was done. ""I was quite nervous and it was slowly, step-by-step surgery, but it went well thanks to David Nott,"" Oleksandr says. Prof Nott, who was born in Carmarthen in west Wales, has previously worked in conflict zones including Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. Fortunately for Oleksandr and his patient, the consultant surgeon at St Mary's Hospital in London had made Ukraine the latest destination in his mission to train doctors how to treat war wounds.  Russia's tactics of bombarding and shelling cities means Ukraine's hospitals are currently seeing many blast injuries. ""It is the worst possible way of attacking the opposition, by simply shelling,"" says Prof Nott, in his first interview since returning from Ukraine. ""It causes enormous damage. It causes dreadful, dreadful injuries."" These include shrapnel wounds to soft tissue, bones and limbs. Even just the shockwave of such a blast can do huge damage, he says. The ""blast wind"" in its wake is capable of amputating limbs. Being thrown against buildings can cause traumatic injuries, too. Barotrauma - physical injury caused by changes in pressure during an explosion - is a particular concern because of Russia's use of thermobaric weapons, also known as vacuum bombs. These can cause bleeds on the brain and in the lungs, causing victims to cough up blood. They are also capable of bursting ear drums and perforating bowels. While he says he has been all over Ukraine - ""north, east, south-east, west"" - Prof Nott does not want to talk about the specific hospitals or areas he has visited for fear that Russian forces will target them - and for the same reason, the BBC is not using Oleksandr's full name or location. During the war in Syria, he used a Skype connection from his office in London to assist with an operation in Aleppo - only for the hospital to be bombed a few days later. He has spoken about how he will never know if the two were connected. Now Prof Nott says 115 hospitals in Ukraine have already been shelled by Russia. ""Blowing up hospitals and killing doctors is a real weapon of war too, it's just despicable,"" he says. While he was in Ukraine, Prof Nott brought as many doctors as possible into operating theatres to watch him carry out operations on warzone injuries, including filling holes in limbs, grafting skin and covering exposed bones. But the mission, a combined venture between his own David Nott Foundation and the humanitarian group UOSSM International, did not end when he left the country as he would soon end up advising Oleksandr remotely before the complicated leg operation. This involved taking a flap of skin from behind the patient's knee to close a wound and prevent infection getting into the exposed bone. ""They are very difficult operations, they are not easy and they go wrong and cause problems,"" Prof Nott says.  But despite these challenges, the result was ""miraculous"", he says. ""It worked really well."" For Oleksandr's part, he says it was important to have the advice of someone with practical experience of the operation: ""It's a relief to us when he tells us it will be OK."" He is full of praise for Prof Nott, who he says has ""showed us ordinary doctors how to fight on the medical frontline"". Oleksandr says knowing how to carry out these types of procedure is ""very necessary in our situation"" because there are so many shelling injuries and open fractures that need to be treated. Prof Nott, through his charity the David Nott Foundation, has translated a series of slides and videos on how to treat war wounds into Ukrainian ""which went on as many of the doctors' phones as it possibly could"". He also hopes those like Oleksandr that he has taught will pass on what they have learned. ""He will train other people how to do it, they'll train other people to do it and then hopefully everyone will know how to do it in the not-too-distant future,"" Prof Nott says. Unfortunately, it seems the demand for these skills in Ukraine will not go away any time soon. Earlier this month, Ukraine's foreign minister said the battles in the eastern Donbas region would resemble World War Two, with the use of ""thousands of tanks, armoured vehicles, planes, artillery"". To Prof Nott, the scenes coming out of cities like Mariupol are reminiscent of what he previously witnessed in Aleppo. ""It's exactly the same as Syria, exactly the same tactics,"" he says. ""Aleppo, when I was there by 2016, was completely flattened, the whole place was completely and utterly destroyed."" Oleksandr says he is now treating ""awful injuries"" that he had hoped never to see. ""We would like to treat normal trauma, like grannies and grandpas who need joint replacements, common fractures,"" he says. But he adds: ""We are doing our job day by day and whatever happens we will stay at home and do what we should do.""

UK weather: Storms and rain bring flash floods to southern England,"Wed, 17 Aug 2022 21:35:50 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-62574134,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-62574134?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,A Met Office warning of storms and flash flooding for the South East continues for the next few hours.,"This video can not be played Watch: Footage shows flash flooding across southern England Thunderstorms and flash floods have struck parts of southern England, causing flash flooding in large areas of central London. Intense downpours began in London and swept the South East on Wednesday.   High Beech, in Essex, saw the highest rainfall with 64mm falling in a 24-hour period, while Frittenden in Kent had 46mm of rain falling in one hour. Light and patchy rain in localised areas is expected over the next few days. The Met Office forecasts that Thursday will be damp in Northern Ireland and western Scotland as rain moves eastwards, with cloudy weather across south-east England and brighter spells for Wales and central England in the afternoon. It follows a day where heavy rain in the capital affected swathes of central London, including Bloomsbury, St Pancras station, Victoria and Kentish Town.  Some shops and platforms at Victoria Station were forced to close after flooding at the main entrance led to large volumes of water running down a slope towards the eastern concourse.  Rain filled the north London high streets of Stoke Newington and Stamford Hill, with cars seen struggling to drive through the water. The Almeida Theatre in Islington had to cancel a matinee performance as water leaked through the roof. Heavy rainfall led to roads across England, Wales and Scotland becoming flooded on Tuesday, following weeks of extreme heat and tinder-dry conditions.  Gatwick Airport in Crawley, West Sussex, has warned of delays and cancellations to some flights as air traffic control restrictions were declared across the south due to poor weather.  Worksop in Nottinghamshire experienced 93mm of rainfall between 17:00 and 20:00 BST on Tuesday - almost twice the average monthly rainfall of 54mm, according to BBC weather presenter Simon King. And more heavy rainfall is expected in England and Wales, with the most intense rain likely to fall in the South East covering London, Kent, West Sussex, Essex and Suffolk. BBC Weather's Stav Danaos said: ""Low pressure pushing in off the Atlantic will bring more of a breeze during Thursday, and this weather front will bring a band of cloud and rain which will slowly spread from west to east across the country.  ""So initially we start of with quite a bit of cloud around, one or two heavy showers in the south east, but increasing amounts of sunshine for central, southern and eastern areas into the afternoon."" He added temperatures are set to peak at 25C in the south-east.  A total of eight areas of England are officially in drought despite the downpours this week, with Thames Water becoming the latest water provider to announce a hosepipe ban, which will come into force later this month.  Pollution warnings are also in place for dozens of beaches in England and Wales after untreated sewage was discharged into the sea around the coast following the period of heavy rain.  Water companies faced criticism, including after untreated sewage had been released upstream of popular swimming spot Warleigh Weir, along the River Avon.  Southern Water, one of the companies responsible for the affected regions, said storm releases were made to ""protect homes, schools and businesses from flooding"", adding the release was ""95-97% rainwater"". Heavy downpours are unlikely to ease parched conditions seen across much of the UK, however, because rainwater struggles to permeate dry ground. The conditions mean water will be more likely to run off the dehydrated surface, leading to flash flooding in some areas. Additional reporting by Rachel Russell.

Rail strikes: Parties struggle to deal with the politics of pain,"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 21:23:10 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-61869655,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-61869655?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Strikes and inflation create major headaches for both the Conservatives and Labour.,"The rail strike is on. Perhaps you're reading this in a long queue for the bus. Or packed on to one of the few trains that is running. The RMT trade union reckons the whole thing has been ""manufactured"" by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. Mr Shapps claims it has been ""created by the unions."" So what will happen next, both on the railways and in the wider economy? The government insists there is no point it getting directly involved in this dispute, arguing that you have to go back decades to find a cabinet minister involved in negotiations with a trade union. Sources also point out there have been around 60 meetings between the industry and the RMT on the fine details of the dispute, and the transport secretary wouldn't be saying anything different were he involved. As soon as next week we can expect ministers to introduce what is known as secondary legislation, a bolt-on to existing laws, that will allow people with the necessary transferrable skills to fill gaps left by striking workers. The plan from ministers in the longer term is a new law that requires a ""minimum service"" to be provided when there are public transport strikes, a promise the Conservatives made in their last election manifesto. In other words, the government is defiant - and so is the RMT. Labour argues all of this is a sign of government failure, but it finds itself in an awkward spot too.  That's because, while the government has condemned the strikes, Labour is more careful in its language. It says it wishes the strikes weren't happening, but doesn't condemn them. And now a row is brewing because a note sent to shadow ministers by the party leadership says: ""Please be reminded that frontbenchers including PPSs should not be on picket lines.""  A PPS is a parliamentary private secretary, an assistant to a frontbencher, but someone expected to toe the party line. ""Please speak to all the members of your team to remind them of this and confirm with me that you have done so,"" the note goes on. But Labour MP Kate Osborne, herself a PPS, has tweeted: ""Come what may, I will be on a picket line supporting workers tomorrow."" The general secretary of the Unite union, Sharon Graham, added: ""To instruct Labour MPs not to be on picket lines with workers speaks volumes. It's time to decide whose side you're on."" The context here, on the railways and in the wider economy, is Covid. Passenger numbers are down by a fifth, and an expensive fifth if you are a train operating company. Commuters and business travellers, who pay a premium to travel at peak times, are not travelling as much. For that reason, ministers argue, change is inevitable. But the union says it is absurd that there is full employment and yet falling wages. Which brings us to the bigger picture. Prices are rising at a speed not seen in 40 years. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Simon Clarke, has said wages in the private and public sector can't keep up with these price rises, or inflation will get worse. The judgement of ministers, in other words, is the only way this gets better in the medium term is for the majority of people to feel poorer in the short term. That's quite a thing for a senior minister to say: Having less money now is a price worth paying for things getting better sooner. As Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies puts it, ""the question for government is how to distribute the pain, across people and across time, not how to avoid it altogether. ""That's not possible. Different interest groups will, entirely understandably, fight their corner. But we can't all win."" Ministers are currently trying to work out how to sell this not entirely palatable message. We can expect a joint speech from the prime minister and the chancellor in the first couple of weeks of next month. It currently has the working title of A Plan for a Stronger Economy, but they've got to decide precisely what they want to say in it. ""One struggles to work out what their economic policy actually is,"" one former minister tells me. ""You need to look like you know what you want to do. ""They have lots of ideas, but it mustn't look random. And it does look random at the moment."" One idea that has been kicked around in recent weeks is return of those Covid-era Downing Street news conferences, perhaps every fortnight, with ministers, slides, graphs and experts. So alongside the chancellor might be an official from the Office for National Statistics, for instance. The rationale is that this would allow ministers to ""level with people"", which is government speak for telling us bad news.

Charles praises Queen's reign as he is formally confirmed as king,"Sat, 10 Sep 2022 19:57:07 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-62860893,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-62860893?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"King Charles III speaks of the Queen's ""selfless service"" as he's formally made king.","King Charles III has praised the Queen's ""unequalled reign"" after being proclaimed king at a ceremony at St James's Palace. The King became the monarch after the death of his mother, but a meeting formally confirmed it on Saturday.  He also approved the day of the Queen's funeral, Monday, 19 September, being a bank holiday. Speaking before the Accession Council, the King said his mother's death had been an ""irreparable loss"".  Meanwhile, senior MPs in the House of Commons, including Prime Minister Liz Truss, swore allegiance to the new monarch.  Making his address in the State Apartments of St James's Palace in London, King Charles said: ""It is the greatest consolation to me to know of the sympathy expressed by so many to my sister and brothers and that such overwhelming affection and support should be extended to our whole family in our loss."" He later spoke of the Queen's ""selfless service"", saying: ""My mother's reign was unequalled in its duration, its dedication and its devotion.  ""Even as we grieve, we give thanks for this most faithful life."" The King added he would ""strive to follow the inspiring example"" he was set by his mother in taking on the ""heavy responsibilities of sovereignty"".  It is the first time the historic ceremony, which dates back centuries, has been televised.  This video can not be played Watch: Charles III is proclaimed King, in a ceremony broadcast for the first time The King himself was not present for the first part of the meeting when he was proclaimed monarch by the Accession Council, made up of senior politicians, judges, and officials.  Clerk of the Privy Council Richard Tilbrook proclaimed Charles ""King, head of the Commonwealth, defender of the faith"", before declaring ""God Save the King"". The packed room, including all of the six living former British prime ministers, repeated the phrase. The proclamation was then read out on a balcony above Friary Court in St James's Palace.  The new King paid warm tribute to his mother, but this was the point when Charles began to look forward to his own reign. Before the Accession Council's ranks of senior politicians and public figures, King Charles dedicated the rest of his life to serving as monarch. It was a mix of ritual, ornate language and constitutional practicality. Charles is now the head of state and here was the seamless and symbolic transfer from one reign to the next, with oaths and signatures. The inkpot used had been given to him by his sons, Prince William and Prince Harry. The announcements also confirmed that the day of the Queen's state funeral would be a public holiday. But here was the King publicly shouldering his new responsibilities, promising to follow in the Queen's example. It was the choreography of continuity. Just before the ceremony inside, hundreds of people were allowed through from the Mall, into the palace's outdoor Friary Court, to witness the proclamation up on the balcony.  They brought their babies and children and carried bunches of flowers. Some brought their dogs on a walk, diverted to witness the moment.   After the state trumpeters played a fanfare, the privy councillors who had left the ceremony and gathered outside raised their voices to say ""God Save the King"".  Cheers of ""hip-hip hooray"" were heard coming from people lining the roads both sides of the palace, and ceremonial guns fired close to nearby Green Park. As senior figures from politics past and present filed away, senior Labour MP Harriet Harman described the ceremony inside as ""solemn"", both because of the death of the Queen and the weight of the occasion for the new King.  The second reading of the Accession Proclamation was also met with applause and cheers outside the Royal Exchange in London on Saturday.  On Saturday afternoon senior MPs took the oath or affirmed in the House of Commons.  Taking her oath, the prime minister said: ""I swear by almighty God that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to His Majesty King Charles, his heirs and successors, according to law, so help me God."" On Saturday afternoon, three of the Queen's children and their families viewed flowers and tributes left outside Balmoral after attending a prayer service at Crathie Kirk, near to the castle. On their return to Balmoral they stopped their cars by the gates as they thanked well-wishers for coming to read the messages left for the Queen. Prince Andrew was seen putting his arm around his daughter, Princess Eugenie, as she wiped a tear from her eyes, while the Countess of Wessex held Lady Louise's hand. After around 10 minutes the family returned to Balmoral Castle. What kind of king will Charles be?

Rollercoaster rides trigger emergency calls from new iPhones,"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 13:52:09 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-63157888,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-63157888?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Users say the rides triggered the phones' crash detection system, US media reports.","Rollercoasters have triggered some new iPhones to make emergency calls. According to the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), at one US amusement park the plummeting rides activated the phones' crash detection system. The feature was introduced in the new iPhone 14 and Apple Watch Series 8, Ultra and SE with the latest OS. Apple told the newspaper the technology is intended to provide ""peace of mind"" and will continue to improve over time. Although a new feature on the iPhone, the crash detection system recently demonstrated its utility alerting emergency services to a fatal accident in Nebraska. Google's Pixel phone already has a crash detection system. Previous reporting by the WSJ testing Apple's system in a variety of collisions - including using the skills of a ""demolition derby"" driver - did not suggest the system was overly sensitive. However, the newspaper was provided with records of six calls to local emergency services from iPhones whose crash detection system had been triggered while on rides at Kings Island amusement park outside Cincinnati, Ohio. In a recording of one of the calls obtained by the newspaper an automated message from an iPhone can be heard saying: ""The owner of this iPhone was in a severe car crash and is not responding to their phone"". The sound of the amusement park is audible in the background. Drivers have also described instances where the crash detection system has been triggered because phones were dropped while their vehicle was moving. Allow Twitter content?

False alerts can waste emergency services' time, and cause distress to relatives. ""We are very vigilant about calls. No call doesn't get checked. You get used to calls that are not an emergency, but it's wear and tear on the dispatchers,"" Melissa Bour, the director of emergency services for Warren County - which received the calls - told the WSJ. Rollercoaster news site Coaster101 noted that Dollywood - a theme park partly owned by country music performer and literacy campaigner Dolly Parton - also warned riders of the risk of false alerts. Signs placed at entrances to two of the park's most ""intense"" roller coasters warned riders that Apple watches and other similar devices should not be taken on the ride, Coaster101's reporter noted, as they could trigger the collision detection feature and cause an unintended emergency call.

According to Apple, the system is designed to detect severe car crashes - such as front-impact, side-impact and rear-end collisions and rollovers. The phone uses a number of sensors to detect a crash, including sound, changes in air pressure caused by airbags deploying, motion sensors and GPS. Following a detected crash, users are given an option to call the emergency services or dismiss the alert.  However, if after 20 seconds the user does not respond, the phone automatically calls emergency services, giving the location of the incident. It also sends a message to a user's emergency contacts if they have them.  Users concerned that a scream-filled trip on a high adrenalin ride might trigger a false alert from their phone can turn the feature off if they wish, or put the phone into airplane mode. Many amusement parks ask people to leave their phone behind before going on a ride.  The BBC has approached Apple for comment.

Jean-Luc Godard: Visionary director's life and films in pictures,"Tue, 13 Sep 2022 14:25:30 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-62889491,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-62889491?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,A look back at the groundbreaking films of French cinematic pioneer Jean-Luc Godard.,"Jean-Luc Godard, who transformed cinema with his radical film-making style, has died at the age of 91. Here is a look back at some of his most seminal works. ""Modern movies begin here,"" wrote film critic Roger Ebert of Godard's debut feature Breathless (A bout de souffle, 1960). ""No debut film since Citizen Kane in 1942 has been as influential."" A tribute to American crime drama, it threw out the conventions of French cinema and embraced an unpolished, experimental style that employed handheld cameras, fast edits and dialogue that was often made up on the spot. The plot wasn't anything new - telling the story of a gangster who shoots a policeman, and the girlfriend who ultimately betrays him - but the attitude and pacing were a breath of fresh air.  It made stars Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jean Seberg, while its amoral, disaffected characters influenced the likes of Al Pacino, Robert De Niro and Quentin Tarantino. Godard followed Breathless with The Little Soldier (Le Petit Soldat, 1961), a thriller that tackled the use of torture by both sides in the Algerian War. Banned for two-and-a-half years by French censors, it was the director's first overtly political statement, leading him to coin the phrase: ""Cinema is truth at 24 frames a second."" It was also the first film in which Godard directed his muse and future wife Anna Karina. Karina also starred in It's My Life (Vivre sa vie, 1962) as a young Parisian, Nana, who aspires to be an actress but ends up a prostitute. The story unfolds over 12 chapters detailing small but crucial events in Nana's life, with the camera often lingering on Karina's face in close-up. Godard said the film was his attempt ""to film a mind in action, the interior of someone seen from outside"". It became one of his biggest critical and commercial successes. Karina appeared again in 1964's Band of Outsiders (Bande Ã  part), a radical reinvention of the gangster film, in which two restless young men (Sami Frey and Claude Brasseur) encourage a woman they're obsessed with to help them commit a robbery... in her own home.  The film includes two iconic sequences - a race against time through the Louvre art gallery, and a stylised line dance in a Parisian cafÃ©, which was referenced in Pulp Fiction's infamous Uma Thurman/John Travolta routine. Godard's 1963 film Contempt (Le MÃ©pris) was his only venture into orthodox, big-budget film-making, starring France's most famous actress, Brigitte Bardot. Adapted from Alberto Moravia's 1954 novel, it follows a failed playwright (Michel Piccoli) who is hired by a corrupt US film producer (Jack Palance) to write a screen adaptation of The Odyssey.  The writer is pressured to make the script more commercial, against the vision of director Fritz Lang (playing himself) - and the compromises he's forced to make sour his relationship with his wife (Bardot). Contempt is often taken as a commentary on the machinations of the film industry, and Godard certainly faced uncomfortable compromises while making it. The opening scene, in which Bardot appears in bed with her husband, was added at the insistence of producers, who were furious that Godard had not included any nudity in his film. In return, he made the scene deliberately un-erotic, shooting Bardot through a series of coloured filters, while underscoring the fragility of her character's marriage.  Contempt may have been Godard's most expensive film at the time - but he was not averse to dressing the set and moving props by himself. He also helped bury Karina and Belmondo on a beach at Porquerolles Island while shooting 1965's Pierrot Le Fou. Another thriller, it tells the story of an unhappily married man who flees Paris with his ex-girlfriend Marianne, who is in turn being pursued by hit-men from Algeria. Godard's 10th film in six years, it was also his last crowd-pleaser of the 1960s, as he started to move ever further towards more radical cinema. Also released in 1965 was the sci-fi film noir Alphaville, starring Eddie Constantine as a secret agent (codename 003) in a dystopian city where love and self-expression are outlawed. He's on a mission to eliminate the mastermind of Alphaville, Professor von Braun, and destroy the dictatorial super-computer, Alpha 60, that controls its citizens. Although the film was set in the distant future on another planet, Godard eschewed special effects and elaborate sets, simply shooting the darker corners of Paris as a substitute for the streets of Alphaville.  Week-End, released in 1967, was a hard-hitting denunciation of modern French society, a road movie about the end of civilisation, and a message that Godard was finished making commercial films. Styled as a black comedy, it follows a bourgeois couple who set out to collect an inheritance from a dying relative, while the country crashes and burns around them.  It features one of the most famous sequences in cinematic history - an eight-minute tracking shot of a traffic jam where the camera travels almost three-quarters of a mile, suggesting that society has become trapped by its possessions. The film closes with two title cards: ""End of story"", followed by ""End of cinema"", highlighting Godard's disillusionment with the cosy predictability of the mainstream. The following year, he helped to shut down the Cannes Film Festival in sympathy with the Paris student riots. In 1968, Godard travelled to the UK intending to make a film about abortion. When that project fell through, he told producers he would only stay in London if he could work with the Beatles or the Rolling Stones. Having failed to interest John Lennon in playing Leon Trotsky, he set up cameras in London's Olympic Studios to film the Stones recording what would become their classic album Beggar's Banquet. There, he captured the goosebump-raising moment when they wrote Sympathy For The Devil. But the resulting film, One Plus One, was less a documentary about music and more a treatise on revolution, creation and destruction. Footage from the studio was intercut with scenes of Godard's second wife Anne Wiazemsky spray-painting words like ""Freudemocracy"" and ""Cinemarxism"" onto cars; while another sequence featured children slapping the faces of white revolutionaries in a pornographic book shop. Godard's original cut didn't include the full performance of Sympathy For The Devil. When it was inserted against his will, he was so incensed that he punched the producer at a screening in London's National Film Theatre. In the 1970s, Godard teamed up with film-maker Jean-Pierre Gorin to create a collective they named the Dziga Vertov Group, after a pioneering Soviet documentary maker who they admired. The films produced in this period - including The Wind From the East, Struggle in Italy and Vladimir and Rosa - were overtly Marxist in tone and struggled to find an audience.  After a period in the wilderness, the director began making successful narrative feature films again in 1979 with Every Man For Himself (Sauve qui peut (la vie)), which he called his ""second first film"".  The unwieldy plot centres on three adult characters and their problems with work and love - with Jacques Dutronc playing a character called Godard, who is an embittered, washed-up and sexist TV director. Premiered at Cannes in 1980 (pictured above), the film was described as ""stunning,"" ""beautiful,"" and ""brilliant"" by the New York Times. Godard's most notable work in the 1980s was his ""trilogy of the sublime"", which consisted of three films that explored femininity, nature and religion: Passion, First Name: Carmen and Hail Mary. The latter starred Myriem Roussel (pictured above) in a modern retelling of the birth of Christ, in which the daughter of a petrol station owner is visited by an angel who tells her she will give birth to the son of God. The religious themes and scenes of full-frontal nudity upset many Christians, who protested outside screenings.  When Godard screened Hail Mary at Cannes in 1985, he was assaulted by Belgian anarchist Noel Godin, who threw a shaving cream pie in his face. Godard responded: ""This is what happens when silent movies meet talking pictures."" With protestors picketing screenings of the film in France, it was only a moderate success. The movie was also banned in Brazil and Argentina. The director made few films in the 1990s, concentrating instead on his eight-part essay Histoire(s) du CinÃ©ma - which first started to take shape in the late 1970s. Described variously as ""an epic poem"", a ""watershed composition"" and ""a sort of intellectual striptease"", it is intensely personal, doggedly intellectual and staggering in its scope. ""Jean-Luc Godard took 30 years to compose his Histoire(s). It might take just as long to absorb it,"" wrote the critic Dave Kehr. Godard returned to film in the 2000s, with meditations on war (Our Music, 2004) and the depiction of love on the big screen (In Praise Of Love, 2001). 2010's Film Socialisme (pictured above) was billed as his final feature, presenting many of his old arguments about the nation state, justice and history in a familiarly fragmented story. ""This film is an affront,"" wrote an infuriated Roger Ebert. ""It is incoherent, maddening, deliberately opaque and heedless of the ways in which people watch movies."" 2014's Goodbye To Language fared better, being named the second best film of the year by the influential Sight & Sound magazine. Godard's first (and only) venture into 3D, its fragmented narrative tells the story of two lovers (and their dog, played by Godard's own pet, Roxy) and their increasing inability to communicate.  As their attempts falter, so to do the subtitles, the soundtrack and even the 3D image, which separates painfully to illustrate the character's disconnection.  The film was awarded the prestigious jury Prize at Cannes. Godard was the recipient of numerous other awards, including an honorary Oscar in 2011, for which the inscription read: ""For passion. For confrontation. For a new kind of cinema."" His final film, 2018's The Image Book, was given a one-off Palme d'Or, while he also owned a Golden Lion from the Venice Film Festival and a Golden Bear from Berlin. In his home country, he was awarded an Honorary CÃ©sar trophy twice, in 1987 and 1988 - with the latter presented by Hollywood legend Clint Eastwood. But he turned down the French National Order of Merit, reasoning: ""I don't like taking orders and I don't have any merits"". Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

Hundreds recalled over shoulder op concerns at Walsall hospital,"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 11:46:47 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-63007107,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-63007107?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Some patients have lost the full use of their arm after surgery at Walsall Manor Hospital.,"This video can not be played Simon Roberts says his partner Angela Glover is in constant pain after shoulder surgery Up to 600 patients are to be recalled by a hospital after concerns were raised about shoulder operations. Some patients have lost the use of their arm after surgery by Mian Munawar Shah at Walsall Manor Hospital. Angela Glover and Martin Crowley live with constant pain and mental health struggles and are unable to sleep. Mr Shah has been suspended. The hospital trust has set up a helpline and will send hundreds of letters to patients who may have been affected. Ms Glover had two operations by Mr Shah - the first, it later emerged after a review, was unnecessary and a screw had been placed inappropriately.  Her partner Simon Roberts said she was in ""constant pain"" and was unable to raise her arm or grip things in her right hand. It has affected her mental health to the point she had to be sectioned after a suicide attempt, Mr Roberts added. ""Angela's not confident to hold a baby and that's very frustrating if you can't pick your grandchildren up and hold them.  ""I see the tears in her eyes sometimes and that breaks my heart too."" Since problems were noticed, the couple have been trying to seek answers but Mr Roberts said: ""We've had to fight and demand every step of the way and I'm still not sure we've been told what's happened - we've still not had any proper explanation."" Mr Crowley had an operation in 2019 after dislocating his shoulder - Mr Shah then replaced the joint when the first operation was unsuccessful. Since then, he said he struggled with basic tasks such as buttoning up a shirt or holding a cup of tea. ""It's affecting me quite bad, there's a lot of stuff I want to do that I can't do,"" he said. Joanne Aldridge was privately operated on by Mr Shah in 2010 at a hospital run by Spire Healthcare.  The trust admitted liability and she has since received compensation after he severed her radial nerve, which left her in terrible pain and unable to lift her arm. In 2016, after Ms Aldridge's payout, she wrote to the General Medical Council's fitness to practise department asking it to investigate Mr Shah for what had happened, because she said she felt sure she was not the only one. The GMC declined, saying her operation was longer than five years ago and the Walsall trust had given Mr Shah a clean bill of health during a revalidation process in 2014. Ms Aldridge added: ""I tried to stop him because I knew that I wasn't the first and I wouldn't be the last. I tried to get something done so others didn't have their lives ruined."" Between 2010 and 2018 there were 21 medical negligence claims relating to Mr Shah's surgery. In 2020, Walsall Healthcare Trust contacted the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) which carried out a general review of surgery and then a further review into Mr Shah's individual work. A recall of his patients was recommended by the RCS. The surgeon has been given an interim order by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS), stopping him from doing laterjet procedures or shoulder joint replacements without supervision.  The MPTS has not commented on its decision not to take Ms Aldridge's 2016 complaint further. It said the High Court had extended interim measures on Mr Shah that had been imposed in 2021.  Medical director at the Walsall trust Dr Manjeet Shehmar told the BBC there had been a failure to carry out multi-disciplinary team meetings and some of the procedures should have been performed in a specialist orthopaedic hospital rather than at Walsall Manor. Chief executive David Loughton, who took over last year, said the trust was not aware of any issues to do with Mr Shah's surgery on knee or hip joints. For the affected patients, there are questions about how risks were not spotted sooner. ""How has this surgeon been allowed to carry on for 15 years and be in a position three years ago to operate on my partner?,"" Mr Roberts said.  ""Why was he not stopped before? How was he allowed to carry on unchecked and no-one has noticed anything? I find that very hard."" Mr Loughton apologised to patients and added he had ""personally met with some of those patients and I am acutely aware of the debilitating effects that this has had on them and how in a lot of cases it has changed their lives"". A Spire Healthcare spokesperson said: ""Mr Munawar Shah has not practised at Spire Little Aston since March 2020. ""We have liaised closely with the Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust throughout their review of his practice, and continue to do so.   ""We are reviewing whether we need to contact and offer support to patients who had particular treatments with Mr Shah at Spire. ""We understand the distress and uncertainty this may cause to patients. Patient safety and the quality of the care we provide to patients remains Spire Healthcare's highest priority."" Mr Shah's solicitor said as matters were ongoing it would be ""inappropriate to comment"". Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Ukraine: India doctor stranded with a jaguar and panther,"Mon, 07 Mar 2022 04:48:02 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-60637980,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-60637980?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Girikumar Patil, who bought two big cats, said he will not leave home without his pets.","For more than a week, an Indian-born doctor in war-torn Ukraine has been holed up in a basement at home with his pet big cats - a black panther and a jaguar.  Gidikumar Patil, who bought the two cats from the Kyiv zoo, says he will not leave home without his pets. He has lived for over six years in Severodonetsk, a small town located in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.  After the war began, Mr Patil, who is single, has been stepping out of his cramped basement only to buy food for his cats - the male jaguar is 20 months old and the female panther is a six-month-old cub - after the curfew ends early in the morning. (The jaguar is a rare hybrid between a male leopard and a female jaguar, he said.)  So far, Mr Patil said he had bought 23kg of sheep, turkey and chicken meat from neighbouring villages at prices four times higher than normal.  ""My big cats have been spending nights in the basement with me. There has been a lot of bombing happening around us. The cats are scared. They are eating less. I can't leave them,"" Mr Patil, 40, told the BBC.  ""This is the second war I am living through. But this is scarier."" Mr Patil said he was earlier living in Luhansk, where Russian-backed rebels have been fighting Ukrainian troops since 2014 despite a ceasefire agreement. During the fighting in the region, his home and an Indian restaurant he opened in the area were destroyed, he said. He then moved to Severodonetsk, about 100km (62 miles) away, bought a new place, began practising medicine and bought his new pets.  ""Now I am stuck in a war zone. This time I am really worried. My parents have been calling me and asking me to come home, but I can't leave the animals,"" Mr Patil said.  Mr Patil, who hails from the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, said that he spent $35,000 (Â£26,460) to buy the panther and the jaguar from the Kyiv zoo about 20 months ago. He said the zoo allowed private sales of animals provided the owner had enough space to keep them - Mr Patil showed the birth certificates of the animals supplied by the zoo. Mr Patil said he arrived in Ukraine in 2007 to study medicine. Since 2014, he has been a practising orthopaedic doctor and now works in a government hospital in Severodonetsk which was shut after the war began. He said he also does private practice.  In Severodonetsk, Mr Patil lives in a six-room two-storey house with a small enclosure for the animals. He said he spent most of his earnings on his pets - he also has three dogs - and tries to raise additional funds through his YouTube channels where he posts videos of his two big cats for some 85,000 subscribers. ""I have always been fascinated with big cats since watching my favourite southern Indian film star, Chiranjeevi, in a film with leopards,"" he said. The son of a bank manager father and a school teacher, Mr Patil said he has always been an ""animal lover"", and kept dogs, cats and birds at home. After high school and college, Mr Patil also dabbled in acting, doing small parts in Telugu soaps. In Ukraine, he said, he had done parts as a ""foreign"" character in half-a-dozen local films and series. The border with Russia was barely 80km from home, Mr Patil said, but it was difficult to reach there because of Russian forces in the region. There had been intermittent power cuts and internet breakdowns in his neighbourhood, but he was able to post video messages on social media regularly. ""I am the only Indian out here, and at night I am alone in the neighbourhood. Most of my neighbours have moved to nearby villages. I am going to hold out,"" he said.

Why Shah Rukh Khan is still 'king of Bollywood',"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 01:25:32 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-62117921,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-62117921?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Thirty years after he began his career, the actor remains among the world's biggest film icons.","Last month, Indian actor Shah Rukh Khan celebrated 30 years in Hindi cinema. Shrayana Bhattacharya, who has written a book on the Bollywood actor's enduring popularity, explains why he is still among the world's biggest film icons.  It is probably facile to offer intellectual reasons to explain Khan's longevity in the film industry. Millions of people unambiguously love the actor to the point that public adulation for him is often dismissed as cringeworthy celebrity worship.  But why is Khan worshipped and loved so much? Much like his films, the answer is romantic and sentimental: Khan has always expressed and represented the best that India and the South Asian subcontinent can be. He shows us a glimpse of a prosperous, plural and humane region - one that can laugh at itself without the inflamed nostrils of pious outrage.   For millions of Indians, he also remains the posterchild of the country's story of economic growth.  In the 1990s, Khan debuted on our screens at the same time as India arrived on the global economy scene. And his stature grew with a growing economy.  As part of a series of market reforms, the country opened the telecoms sector to foreign investment which allowed new media networks to broadcast in India - these channels ensured Khan's films, songs and interviews reached more homes than any film celebrity before him. As India liberalised its economy further, new sodas and cars suddenly entered the market, and partnered with Khan as their brand ambassador.  In that sense, Khan's meteoric rise from a humble Delhi family to global celebrity is the penultimate neo-liberal fairy tale of success in India, an example of how to ""make it"" to the top without any film lineage or connections to prop him up. Khan's stature grew with a growing economy. With the rise of the religious right, Khan has also become a shorthand for a progressive plural past that many Indians are trying to hold on to. Critics say intolerance has been on the rise under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist government, which is widely accused of marginalising India's Muslims.  Khan's son, Aryan Khan, was arrested last year in a drugs case, and eventually exonerated, in a case many felt was aimed at targeting India's most successful Muslim icon. He has always offered thoughtful comments on Indian pluralism and played more Muslim characters than his contemporaries.  Yet, his fans refuse to reduce him to his religious identity - instead, they see him as wise, witty, successful, and wildly sexy.  Discussing the malicious right-wing attacks against Khan and his mixed-faith family - his wife is a Hindu - a young fan I interviewed declared: ""He is secular, but he is also very sexy.""  Most importantly, the actor has always depicted the fragility we all share as human beings.  Khan usually portrays fragile figures - the fragile lover, the fragile hero, the fragile husband, the fragile Muslim, and even the fragile villain. The men he plays are rarely at ease with themselves and those around them. The insecurities that bother his screen characters have evolved through the progress of his career spanning three decades. They are often emotionally destitute, unable to feel fully loved and unwilling to let go of their need to find love.  Khan is also South Asia's romantic superhero - his films are the standard that all desi romances attempt to match up to.  Data shows that his characters engage with women much more than the roles played by other Bollywood male stars. But the love Khan's characters seek is not only the traditional love of a woman, they desperately seek the love and approval of fathers, friends and fellow countrymen.  The men he plays feel deeply, are constantly vulnerable to the gaze of the Other, and shed many, many (many) tears. Film writers often comment on how Khan can cry better than most actors in the world. These teary-eyed displays of humanity have only endeared him to countless fans.  Beyond the movies, his television interviews and public lectures have amplified his humour and humility.  I know many elite urban fans who obsess over Khan's interviews more than his films. These media conversations mark the actor's best performance till date: his version of the unapologetic middle-class superstar.  Khan has crafted a deliciously arrogant and poised public persona, forever seducing us with moments of self-disclosure followed by self-deprecating intellect and bitter sarcasm.  Chain-smoking, brazen, self-aware and hilarious, Khan is never boring. He goes from offering sound advice on dealing with financial insecurities and troubled friendships to cracking hilarious jokes about ageing in the film industry and his own sexuality. In all his quotes and jokes about himself and the world, there is always the hint of a man who works hard, cares deeply for his craft and enjoys laughing at himself.  In a world of uncertain and harsh realities, Khan's fantastical images remain a source of awe, escape and entertainment.  After a hiatus, the actor has three big releases lined up for 2023. His fans are giddy with excitement, but they are also wary of right-wing social media campaigns that advocate the boycott of Muslim icons and Bollywood releases.  As our politics becomes deeply divisive, the actor's power lies in how he can unite so many of us in smiles and stories. I cannot wait for the next 30 years of this icon - our broken culture desperately needs his wry jokes and wide-open arms.

Alan Shearer column: 'This is a different Arsenal - but they are not title contenders yet',"Sun, 18 Sep 2022 17:19:58 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62946685,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62946685?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Match of the Day pundit Alan Shearer says it is not time to talk about Arsenal as title contenders yet, but Sunday's win over Brentford epitomised their progress under Mikel Arteta."," Last updated on 18 September 202218 September 2022.From the section Arsenal It's not time to talk about them as title contenders yet, but people now know that this is a different Arsenal to the team we saw just 13 months ago. The Gunners' 3-0 win at Brentford on Sunday epitomised their progress under Mikel Arteta, because we all remember what happened in this fixture on the opening weekend of last season - when the Bees didn't just beat them, they bullied them. Everything was different about Arsenal this time - in attack and defence, plus the way they controlled the game, and with their attitude and intensity. They ran out comfortable winners. Part of that was down to how bad Brentford were, but it was Arsenal's performance that made the Bees play so poorly. I was expecting Brentford to come out flying, knowing what worked last time, and trying to hurt Arsenal. They tried to play that way again, but it didn't work because they faced a very different Arsenal team. This Gunners side is not only bigger and stronger, it is also more committed. They were better in every department and dominated right from the start. When the Bees did attack in the same way they had at Arsenal before, with long throws or crosses into the box, they got absolutely no joy at all.  Their two strikers, Ivan Toney and Bryan Mbeumo, hardly got a kick because Gabriel and William Saliba dominated them so much, and it was the same all over the pitch. Yes, Brentford gave Arsenal too much time and space for their second and third goals, but those were far from the only occasions that they could not get near to them. Only four of the Arsenal team who started that defeat against Brentford began Sunday's game too - Ben White, Kieran Tierney, Granit Xhaka and Gabriel Martinelli. In just over a year, Arteta has not just built a different team, he has transformed the mood of the whole club. He deserves great credit for that, because he got a lot of criticism after the way they started last season, with three straight defeats. This time, they have won six out of their first seven league games and go into the international break at the top of the table. They deserve it too. It's been a strange start to this campaign by some of the big clubs, with Liverpool being nowhere near the levels we know they can be. Chelsea have been the same, and they have had more upheaval after their change of manager. Manchester United made a really poor start too but they have recovered well, while Tottenham are still unbeaten and are right up there along with Manchester City, who are still the team to beat. I still think Arsenal's main target is a return to the top four for the first time since 2016, and they have not done too much wrong so far. Their next two league games at the start of October, at home to Spurs and Liverpool, will tell us more about whether they can sustain this strong start but, right now, their fans will be enjoying what they are seeing. Toney has had an exciting week after getting an England call-up with the World Cup only a couple of months away, but this was a game to forget for the Brentford striker. We know Toney usually relishes a battle with defenders and thrives on balls into the box, but here he lost most of his aerial battles and it was one of those days where he has to hold his hands up and say the opposition centre-halves were better than he was. I am sure he will recover from this pretty quickly though, especially because he is going away with England for the next 10 days or so. He should get on at some stage against either Italy or Germany too, and it is a big chance for him to impress. Only one striker stood out for me at Gtech Community Stadium on Sunday though - Arsenal's number nine. Gabriel Jesus has been brilliant since joining from Manchester City in the summer, and with four goals and three assists so far only Erling Haaland (with 11) has been involved in more Premier League goals than him this season. We've seen Arteta improve the likes of Xhaka, who showed great desire and determination against Brentford, but Jesus is Arsenal's real game-changer for me. His move was seen as his opportunity to be the main man after often being on the bench at City and he has certainly taken it so far. Jesus is already a huge part of what Arsenal are about now - it's not just his goals and creativity that make him so important to them, it's his relentless energy and willingness to run in behind defences too.

Stormzy tour review: Star praises fans who waited two years to see him,"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 01:56:06 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-60756983,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-60756983?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The star thanks fans who held onto tickets for two years as his Heavy Is The Head tour launches.,"""This is that expensive rap,"" says Stormzy, half-way through the track Rachael's Little Brother. ""It's coming like a dying art."" The lyric isn't a monetary reference, he's explained, but a metaphor for the sort of ""classy, skilled, catching-all-the-pockets"" lyricism he aspires to. And yetâ¦ he's not afraid to loosen the purse strings when circumstances demand. Take, for example, the star's first UK arena tour, which hit Newcastle on Tuesday night.  Put together by the teams behind BeyoncÃ©'s historic Coachella set and Stormzy's 2019 Glastonbury performance, it's a lavish, no-corners-cut, stage and light show that asserts the Stormzy's status as the country's biggest rapper. This is the sort of show that makes room for pyrotechnics in almost every song; alongside a 12-piece band, a two-pronged catwalk, five budget-busting video screens and - symbolism ahoy - a serpentine lighting rig that twists into the shape of a crown. But for all that spectacle, the main focus is the man born Michael Owuo Jr - from the moment he emerges on a swaying platform, high above the arena floor; to the closing bars of Vossi Bop, where his vocals are drowned out by 11,000 phone-wielding fans. He opens the show with a trio of his fiercest songs - Big Michael, Audacity and Know Me From - high-stepping through fireworks as he whips the crowd into a frenzy. For the first half an hour, he's the only person on the stage, his charismatic swagger the show's sole source of energy (if it could be bottled, it could presumably solve the fuel crisis). Acknowledging that all eyes are on him, the ultra HD video screens emphasise his lyrics - especially on the punchy First Things First, which tackles everything from depression to institutional racism, via the demonisation of UK rap and his love of Adele. After six songs, Stormzy switches up the pace with a stirring gospel-soul section that introduces a full live band, featuring no less than six backing singers. They lead us through the star's more contemplative songs (Crown, Superheroes, Do Better) while adding a late-night urgency to the sensually-charged Cigarettes & Cush. As the tempo slows, the star lets out his playful side, flirting with the crowd and busting out some surprisingly supple dance moves.  ""We're going to create some memories tonight,"" he declares. ""I want everyone to leave here with a little bit of joy in their heart."" To be brutally honest, the slow-groove soul revue outstays its welcome by at least two songs - and it's a relief when Stormzy ratchets the energy back up with the ferociously articulated Wiley Flow (the line ""I can't drop the bag, I am the bag,"" remains a highlight of his discography). The pace doesn't falter after that, as the star races through his biggest hits - Clash, Big For Your Boots, Blinded By Your Grace, Shut Up and Vossi Bop.  Some of these are performed inside a giant, oscillating scale of justice (which, like the metaphor, went completely over my head). Others are delivered, to maximum audience approval, while wearing a Newcastle United t-shirt that's been thrown onstage. Throughout the show, Stormzy is in jubilant form, turning the Utilita Arena into a giant shoobz, or all-out grime party. For many in the audience, it was their first concert since the Covid lockdowns - a fact that wasn't lost on the star. ""A lot of you bought a ticket two years ago, so to see you here today is a real thing,"" he said.  ""The past two years for meâ¦ I've done a lot of growing as a man and I've been making music, and I've been chilling, and I've been spending time with my family, and I've been so away from everything.  ""So even driving to the arena and seeing everybody waiting outside, I was like, 'We're still here man, we're still alive.' I love you guys."" And for all the expense and all of the spectacle, that's what endears Stormzy to his fans: The humanity of his music and his actions. That's why the best moment of this, the first full show of his 2022 tour, came after the music finished and the house lights went up.  Instead of being whisked away to a velvet-roped VIP area, Stormzy climbed off the stage and spent time with the people who'd waited two years to see him. The crowd frequently threatened to swallow him whole - but he was undeterred, shaking hands and posing for selfies for as long as time would allow. It was a personal gesture of gratitude; a sign that, for all of his stature, Stormzy knows where his power comes from.  And he repaid that debt by announcing his forthcoming third album to them first - not on social media, or in an exclusive interview with Rolling Stone, but in a video played exclusively to the fans in the arena. This is that expensive rap, and it's coming like a dying art. The Heavy Is The Head Tour continues through March and April with dates in Leeds, Sheffield, Manchester, Liverpool, London and more.

"GCSE and A-levels: Mistakes in papers caused ‘pupil distress’, Ofqual says","Fri, 17 Jun 2022 21:02:26 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-61844041,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-61844041?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Exam boards have apologised for mistakes in this year's A-level and GCSE papers.,"Exam boards have been criticised by a watchdog for oversights on GCSE and A-level papers where pupils were tested on topics they were told would not come up or sat papers with mistakes. In England students were given extra detail because of the pandemic. But an AQA A-level law and GCSE physics paper included topics not listed in ""advance information"". Watchdog Ofqual said such mistakes caused ""distress"" for pupils.  Another exam board, Edexcel, has apologised for labelling Gabon as the Republic of Congo on a map of Africa, in its GCSE geography paper. And Wales' main exam board, WJEC, said sorry for excerpts from three Shakespeare plays being either partly or fully missing from their English language and literature paper. On Friday, AQA said sorry to A-level law students for the ""confusion and stress"" after questions on nuisance were included in their paper, despite there being no advance warning that the subject would be included in the exam. The exam board has not yet announced how the question will be marked. ""The fairest way to address this is for us to look at how students performed on this paper after we've marked it, and we'll take any action necessary to protect them,"" a spokesperson for AQA said. Coralie Foster, from Bolton, said her daughter was ""more angry than upset"" at the surprise question in the A-Level law paper on Monday.  She added: ""Nowadays these university offers are so high - so the pressure on these kids to get the top grades is immense. ""Advance information was meant to help focus that work, but it's all been completely undermined."" Last week AQA apologised for a question on energy transfers and circuits that appeared in a GCSE physics paper. Circuits had not been included as a topic for revision in the advance information. The board said it would give all students full marks for that question. GCSE student Eddie, from Greater Manchester, took the physics paper on 9 June, and said he was ""disappointed"" with AQA's response.  ""I don't know how they could make a mistake like that,"" he said. He said awarding full marks had rectified the error ""somewhat"", but believes it will not fully account for the students who spent extra time trying to answer the unexpected question.  ""Pupils came home upset, disappointed and disadvantaged. It's just thrown a lot of spanners into the works,"" he said.  Speaking to the Confederation of School Trusts' annual conference on Friday, Jo Saxton - Ofqual's chief regulator - said the idea of providing advance information to help students prepare for exams had ""taken the stress off of [pupils'] shoulders"". But she added: ""They love the idea of the advance information, but the reality is they found navigating it, in many cases, just one other thing to think about. ""I absolutely understand the distress that mistakes in advance information and exam papers cause."" In 2020 and 2021, students were graded based on assessments made by their teachers, with exams cancelled in order to reduce the spread of Covid. Under the teacher assessments, more students passed exams and achieved higher marks, with record numbers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland securing top A-level grades. Although grades will be awarded normally this year, grade boundaries will be more lenient in England, Scotland and Wales. They will be set at a ""mid-point"" between the 2019 pre-pandemic boundaries and the grade levels used in teacher assessments in 2021. However, much of the support for exams this year will be scrapped in 2023.  Correction: An earlier version of the story said AQA was criticised by Ofqual but the watchdog criticised exam boards, not specifically AQA.  How exams will be different this year Parents and teachers step in to oversee exams More generous grading for GCSE and A-level exams WJEC apologises after exam paper blunder China attacks 'bandit logic' of TikTok vote in US SpaceX launches Starship rocket in third attempt Hundreds rescued from Philippines love scam centre How Malaysia Airlines came back from twin tragedies Rosenberg: Russia's stage-managed election The story of I Will Always Love You, 50 years on Zuma - the political wildcard in South Africa's poll 'Every day felt like an eternity' - freed Israeli hostage.

Police arrest suspect in New York subway shooting 'without incident',"Thu, 14 Apr 2022 00:12:04 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-61100179,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-61100179?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"""We got him,"" says New York mayor following massive manhunt in wake of the Brooklyn subway shooting.","This video can not be played Watch: 'We got him': man arrested in New York subway shooting Police in New York City have arrested a man suspected of shooting 10 commuters in a rush hour attack at a Brooklyn subway station. Frank James, 62, is alleged to have donned a construction worker's helmet, vest and a gas mask before throwing smoke grenades and opening fire.  A massive 30-hour manhunt was launched in the wake of the attack.  Mr James was taken into custody on Wednesday afternoon in Manhattan after police received a tip-off, they said.   ""My fellow New Yorkers: we got him,"" Mayor Eric Adams said via video during a news conference.   Officials said Mr James was the sole suspect in the shooting at Brooklyn's 36th Street station on Tuesday morning, in which 23 people were wounded, 10 of them from gunfire. The attack renewed calls to address violence in the city's transit system.  Keechant Sewell, New York's police commissioner, said that Mr James was arrested ""without incident"". ""There was nowhere left for him to run,"" she said.  Police did not answer questions about the individual who called in the tip, though the Associated Press and CNN are reporting the suspect was the one who tipped off police to his location in lower Manhattan.  Mr James will be charged on several counts, authorities said, including the violation of a federal law which prohibits ""terrorist and other violent attacks"" against mass transit systems. He could face life in prison if found guilty.  He had nine prior arrests, police said, and he had ties to Ohio, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.  The search for Mr James was complicated by malfunctioning cameras inside the subway station. Officials on Wednesday were working to determine whether one or multiple cameras at the station were broken. The suspected gunman escaped the scene but was linked to the attack through a rented U-Haul van. The key to the van, rented in Philadelphia, was found at the scene, along with a Glock 9mm handgun, three ammunition magazines, a plastic container containing petrol, and a credit card with Mr James' name on it, police said.  An FBI affidavit said the agency believes Mr James rented the U-Haul in Philadelphia on Monday and drove it to New York, arriving the next day. The agency said that records showed the Glock was lawfully bought in Ohio ""by an individual named 'Frank Robert James'"".   Police have not given a motive for the attack, though authorities have said Mr James had posted black nationalist rhetoric and bigoted rants online and ""made various statements about the New York City subway system"", including about homeless people on the subways and ""various conspiracy theories"",  according to court documents, Mr James is expected to make his first court appearance in New York on Thursday.

Bungee jumper sets world record at Perthshire bridge,"Wed, 01 Jun 2022 12:50:06 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-61594837,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-61594837?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,A 44-year-old Frenchman completed 765 leaps in 24 hours at the Garry Bridge in Perthshire.,"This video can not be played Francois-Marie Dibon completed his world-record breaking attempt on Wednesday morning A Frenchman has broken the world record for completing the most amount of bungee jumps in a 24-hour period off a Scottish bridge. Francois-Marie Dibon, 44, completed 765 leaps at Garry Bridge in Killiecrankie, Perthshire. He beat the previous record of 430 leaps, which was set by New Zealander Mike Heard in 2017, after only 12 hours. The new record was overseen by Guinness World Records judge Joanne Brent. Mr Dibon said:  ""I did not doubt we could do it. ""We have been building a performance for some time. We were lucky and blessed that it worked well.""  When the final jump was completed, he celebrated with the jump crew on the platform to the Queen song We Are The Champions.  Mr Dibon, an actuary who works in Stockholm, said he had a fear of heights as a youngster. He made his first bungee jump in 2011. As recently as March, Mr Dibon was suffering the equivalent of sea-sickness, due to the constant motion of going up and down on the elasticated bungee cord. However, he said he overcame this after completing 25 hours a week in the gym, focusing on cardio and core muscle stints, and learning breathing techniques. Mr Dibon completed the challenge with 15 crew members from Highland Fling Bungee, who worked in shifts throughout the 24-hour period.

The science of drought explained in pictures,"Fri, 12 Aug 2022 11:53:33 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-62519107,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-62519107?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"What does drought mean and what are the implications for water, food, rivers and wildlife?","From all the pictures of parched fields, dusty soil and dried-up reservoirs, it might appear obvious there's a drought. But from a scientific point of view, it's more complicated than that. There's no one definition of drought - it's different depending on whether you look at weather, agriculture or water flow in rivers and streams. And when it comes to declaring an ""official"" drought, government agencies look at how the long dry spell is affecting food production, water supplies and the environment.  That includes how much rivers and streams are shrinking, which puts wildlife and water supplies at risk. They also look at threats to crops and livestock if fields are turned into dust bowls. One big indicator for drought is hydrology - the flow of water through rivers and the state of the water stored underground in permeable rocks beneath the soil. These are crucial for supplying the drinking water that reaches our taps.  Rivers are running at exceptionally low levels in much of southern England and Wales, including the River Yscir, Colne and Wye. There are reports of streams drying up and rivers shifting downstream.  The amount of water stored in aquifers - the layer of spongy rock that soaks up water - is below normal for this time of the year. Reservoirs are also running empty. At the end of July reservoirs were at their lowest levels in England and Wales since records began in 1990, according to the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. But it should be noted that there's something of a north-south divide. Because of the UK's geological make-up and the influence of weather patterns, some parts of northern England and Scotland are escaping the worst of the parched conditions.  Rivers in the north are generally at higher levels and also respond much more quickly when rain falls. That said, the drought in much of southern England and parts of Wales is likely to persist for some time. Even if it does rain, it'll take a long time for river levels to fill up enough to return to normal flows. Experts warn the extreme weather will likely lead to smaller harvests, which will make the food we buy in the supermarkets even more expensive. Scientists will be monitoring the impacts of the drought on wildlife. As water courses dry up or run low, habitats for fish and invertebrates start to shrink, with knock-on effects for animals higher up the food chain. And pollutants in rivers become more concentrated, amplifying their impact on wildlife. Experts will also be looking at the wider question of the links between heatwaves, drought and climate change. The UK has experienced regular periods of drought in the past, including the last official drought in 2018-19. And to a certain extent, drought is normal and part of natural weather cycles across the world. But dry conditions are also expected to become more frequent and intense as Earth moves beyond the 1.2Â°C of climate change we have seen to date. The ten warmest years on record in the UK have occurred in the 21st century, with data stretching back to 1884. Climate scientists say that the UK's extreme heat in July would have been ""almost impossible"" without human-induced climate change. July was the driest in England since 1935, with many areas seeing far less rainfall than average.  The latest set of simulations for the UK project hotter and drier summers, plus warmer and wetter winters, with larger changes in summer compared to winter rainfall. That means water companies and farmers will have to plan how to harvest and store rain in winter to address shortages in the summer. Follow Helen on Twitter @hbriggs.

Ukraine war: The Telegram group tracing missing relatives,"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 00:24:49 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60678083,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60678083?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,A group of women work 24/7 to help find loved ones separated by the war in Ukraine.,"Thousands of families have been separated in the chaos of fighting in Ukraine. Power cuts and disruption to internet and mobile phone services mean many have gone weeks without hearing news of loved ones in areas hit by intense Russian shelling. Sergey was sheltering with his family in a bomb shelter when he left to get food. Fierce fighting meant he couldn't get back to them, and the next day his phone went dead. Desperate for news, his brother Vladimir turned to a Telegram group set by a Ukrainian TV presenter which shares information about missing people.  The group, called Search for the Missing, has grown to more than 80,000 members since it launched earlier this month, and receives thousands of pleas for help every day. Hours after he posted about his brother, and four days after Sergey went missing, Vladimir got a phone call from the family of Sergey's wife in Kyiv, who had seen the message. ""By the end of the day, they called to tell me that my brother had made his way to them,"" Vladimir said.  Sergey had made it to another shelter, but with no food and water, he and the people he was with decided to surrender to Russian troops. ""They took a white flag and went out to the Russians. After a search, they were released. Then with the help of volunteers, he drove to Kyiv,"" Vladimir says. The rest of Sergey's family eventually made it out of Bucha and to safety in Gdansk, Poland. ""I experienced feelings that I have never experienced in my life,"" Vladimir says. ""It was such welcome news in these difficult days."" Sergey has since returned to Ukraine to join the army, he says. Search for the Missing was started by Katya Osadcha, a former model, journalist and popular reality TV presenter. She was desperate to help when the war started, but felt she ""couldn't shoot or be a soldier"" because she has two small children.  Instead, she asked friends on Instagram to help and now she and 15 volunteers run the group 24 hours a day, checking each message for details, and filtering out duplicates. 'Overwhelmed' Katya says they have helped about 300 people find missing relatives, each one a happy update - a flurry of red hearts, praying and crying emojis - among the channel's endless stream of desperate pleas for information. ""You receive pictures of happy people on holidays, and their friends and family are writing to us saying that they are missing and the last call was five days ago from a shelter, and there has been a lot of bombing."" Emma Shymanovych, who helps run the channel, says the small team of volunteers has been overwhelmed: ""It's extremely painful to read enquiries about lost children, or about children looking for their parents. It's hard to express what we feel."" Yulia, 25, left her mother, brother and sister behind when she escaped the city of Mariupol with her husband and two-month-old baby: ""The last time I spoke to them, they had not had electricity, water, heating and communications for several days."" When she couldn't get through to them, Yulia contacted local authorities and friends who might still be in the city to see if they knew anything, but got nowhere, and posted on the Telegram channel. ""I push the worst thoughts away from me,"" she said. ""I really hope they're safe and they just don't have a connection. I only hope for an immediate ceasefire."" Not long after we spoke, Yulia sent me a message to tell me her mother had finally been able to make contact, but was still in Mariupol. ""She spoke for just a minute. Thank God!""  Iryna posted a picture of her friend's 23-year-old daughter Julia, after she went missing in Kyiv. ""Her mother was crying constantly,"" she says. She tried asking for news on Facebook and other Telegram channels, eventually turning to Search for the Missing. ""Within 24 hours I started getting responses from people who knew her. Some said they didn't know anything, but then her friends got in touch and said Julia had broken her phone and hadn't been able to make contact."" Julia had dropped her phone when she was running to a bomb shelter and she didn't know her mother's phone number off by heart.  Thousands more are still trapped in Mariupol. Olga, who lives in Istanbul, posted in the channel after losing contact with her 31-year-old daughter Daria and her two grandchildren Mark, 4, and Lydia, 5, who live there. Olga last heard from her daughter on 28 February. In a text message, Daria wrote that a shell had hit their apartment building, and there was no electricity or heating. ""I don't know what to do at all"" the message said. ""I'm scared. The children are dressed, there are a lot of blankets. Mariupol is encircled by the enemy. We have a very bad connection."" Olga has almost given up hope of hearing from them. Monday was her daughter's birthday. ""I'm terrified of everything and I never thought that my family would be affected by war"" she says.  Olga, from Bakhmut, posted in the group to try to find news of her daughter, Alice, and eight-month-old grandson, Timofey, in Mariupol. The last she heard from them, they were sheltering with neighbours in the basement of a supermarket without electricity, water or heating. Since then, she has received a message that the building they were hiding in was bombed, and she is anxiously waiting for more news. ""Whether they are alive and where they are now - I don't know.""

Windrush Day: Waterloo Station statue to be unveiled,"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 23:47:54 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-61884535,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-61884535?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"The monument pays tribute to the Windrush generation's ""dreams, ambition, courage and resilience"".","This video can not be played WATCH: A Windrush monument is unveiled at Waterloo Station The Queen has praised the Windrush ""pioneers"" for their ""profound contribution"" to British life as a statue to them was unveiled. The monument, at Waterloo Station, pays tribute to the thousands of people who arrived in the UK from Caribbean countries between 1948 and 1971. It depicts a man, woman and child standing on top of suitcases and was revealed to mark Windrush Day. The government gave Â£1m to fund the statue, designed by Basil Watson. In a message to mark the occasion, signed Elizabeth R, the Queen said she hoped the statue would ""inspire present and future generations"" as she sent her ""warmest good wishes on this historic occasion"". Windrush Day marks the arrival of Caribbean immigrants to the shores of Britain on 22 June each year - the day HMT Empire Windrush arrived at Tilbury Docks in 1948.  The Queen's grandson the Duke of Cambridge helped to unveil the statue, alongside his wife the Duchess of Cambridge, and also paid tribute to the contributions of the Windrush generation, and their descendants to British life. ""Without you all Britain would simply not be what it is today,"" he said. ""I want to say a profound thank you to every member of that generation and the generations that have followed."" But Prince William also talked about how the ""past weighs heavily"" on the people of the Caribbean and the Windrush generation. He said members of the Windrush generation had been victims of racism when they arrived and said ""discrimination remains an all too familiar experience for black men and women in Britain in 2022"". The duke referred to the Windrush scandal, which broke in April 2018, and said it still ""rightly reverberates through the Caribbean community here in the UK"". The scandal, which saw members of the Windrush generation and their children wrongly detained and even deported, led to the UK government apologising for the deportation threats many faced.  Windrush passengers Alford Gardner and John Richards helped the royals to unveil the statue. Jamaican artist and sculptor Mr Watson has said he was ""truly honoured"" to have been chosen to create the monument. The government said the statue would ""create a permanent place of reflection and inspiration and be a visible statement of our shared history and heritage"". Earlier to mark Windrush Day, Prince William and Catherine met young British-Caribbean creatives at the Brixton House theatre in south London, with the duchess trying her hand at photography and the duke chatting to R&B musician Abdoulaziz Lelo Ndambi. They also met youth workers at Lambeth Council's Elevate programme and attended a workshop led by production agencies Iconic Steps and Oxygen Art. High-profile names, including actor Lenny Henry and poet Benjamin Zephaniah, have called for next year's Windrush Day to be a ""major national moment"" to mark the 75th anniversary. More than 100 leaders across different sectors have signed a joint letter, published in The Times, starting the one-year countdown to the milestone. The letter reads: ""This is not only black history - it is British history. It should be something we all know and commemorate."" Patrick Vernon, convenor of the Windrush 75 network, which is co-ordinating efforts over the next 12 months, said it was a piece of history ""every child should learn about at school"" and called for it to be commemorated as a major event. But not everyone has been supportive of the unveiling of the statue with activist Prof Gus John describing it as ""a monument to unforgivable political illiteracy and an entrenched colonial mindset"". In an open letter to Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove, dated 9 June, declining an invitation to the unveiling, he said the ""entire Windrush narrative distorts the history of Caribbean engagement with Britain and of Britain's relentless efforts to keep us out"". Vincent McBean, president of the West Indian Association of Service Personnel, supported the creation of the memorial but said it could have been located in a better place. ""In the heart of Brixton is Windrush Square, what would have been more befitting for it to have been put in the square,"" he said, adding that it had been Lambeth Council which had initially embraced those who arrived from the Caribbean. The government says the location was chosen because thousands of members of the Windrush generation passed through Waterloo Station on their way to start new lives across the UK. They are known as the Windrush generation, in reference to the HMT Empire Windrush, one of the ships that carried them to the UK to fill labour shortages, in the first wave of Commonwealth immigration. Under the 1971 Immigration Act, all Commonwealth citizens already living in the UK were given indefinite leave to remain. But thousands of the Windrush generation arrived in the UK as children and did not have official documentation.  Following immigration law changes in 2014, many were told they were in the UK illegally, despite living and working in the country for decades.

'They started hunting for me': Ukraine politicians face torture in Russian detention,"Thu, 14 Jul 2022 23:17:02 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-62022450,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-62022450?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Local politicians in occupied regions of Ukraine say they were abducted, beaten and tortured.","Hundreds of Ukrainians, including civilians and local politicians, are being subjected to forced detentions by Russian forces in occupied regions, the UN has told the BBC.  Officials said they had verified some 271 cases of forced detentions, with many of those seized facing torture. Separately, a Ukrainian politician told the BBC that he was waterboarded after being abducted by the Russian military. Russia's defence ministry did not reply to a request for comment on the claims. Oleh Pylypenko, the elected head of the Shevchenkivska united territorial community in southern Ukraine, said he was seized by Russian paratroopers near Kherson on 10 March while delivering aid to constituents.  Warning: this article contains descriptions of torture The 36-year-old told the BBC that he was arrested along with his driver at a roadblock by Russian troops and suspected he was deliberately targeted after sharing the locations of Russian artillery with Ukrainian forces. ""I think that they started hunting specifically for me almost from the very start of the war. I believe they were planning an ambush because they wanted to take me alive,"" he said. He was subsequently taken to an airfield, where allegedly he was tortured for three days by Russian paratroopers. ""They didn't touch my driver,"" Mr Pylypenko recalled. ""They were interrogating only me. They used physical violence, electric currents and poured cold water over me during freezing temperatures outside. I had frostbite on my feet, damaged ribs and internal organs."" The father of three added that paratroopers also beat him with a ""rubber club"" and kicked him until he passed out. He also alleged that he was repeatedly subjected to electric shocks by the Russian troops.  ""On the third day of all this I was so badly beaten up that I unable to move [independently]. And I wouldn't have survived without my driver, who was helping me all the time,"" he said.  Mr Pylypenko said he later became the subject of a turf war between paratroopers - who wanted to execute him for his part in helping Ukrainian forces target their positions - and military police, who wanted him to use his position to help organise prisoner swaps. ""These two groups had had an internal conflict about who would be further dealing with this prisoner of war. Because the paratroopers had just wanted to destroy me,"" he said.  The military police officers eventually won the fight, and after arranging 11 rounds of prisoner exchanges, Mr Pylypenko was finally released on 10 June.  A spokesperson for the UN's Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights (UNOHR), whose monitoring mission in Ukraine has been documenting the abductions, told the BBC that at least 65 local politicians had been detained by Russian forces since the invasion began on 24 February.  They added that UN monitors had ""documented cases of torture and ill-treatment of civilians subjected to enforced disappearances"", which they said had taken place in improvised and former official places of detention controlled by either ""Russian armed forces"" or ""affiliated armed groups"".  Complaints included ""credible allegations of beatings, strangling, electrocution, sexual violence, positional torture, and threats of execution with firearms, threats of physical violence against relatives, and providing no or scarce food"", said the UNOHR. In the occupied port city of Mariupol, an adviser to the city's elected mayor told the BBC he had received reports that a civil servant was executed by Russian forces after spending time in detention.  Petro Andryushchenko said the man, who had been a director with the city's transport authority, was tried and sentenced to death by a Russian-backed court.  The BBC cannot independently verify the report, and the UN said while it had received ""allegations of the killings of civilians in Mariupol outside of hostilities, allegedly perpetrated both by Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups"" in the city, it had not yet been able to corroborate them. But Mr Andryushchenko affirmed that mass detentions were ongoing in the region and that around 10,000 people had been arrested by Russian forces.  Local politicians who ""don't want to work with the regime"" or representatives from ""pro-Ukrainian parties"" are among the most frequent targets, he said. Former police officers, Red Cross volunteers and civilians who held pro-Ukrainian views were also being targeted in the city, he said, with many being sent to former Ukrainian prisons and makeshift ""filtration"" camps.  Dmytro Vasyliev, a former speaker of the local council in the occupied southern city of Nova Khakova, told the BBC that he was arrested by Russian proxy forces from the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic in March. Mr Vasyliev was held for 46 days before being released. During his detention he was repeatedly interrogated by balaclava-clad guards who pressured him to collaborate with the occupying force.  ""I was called for questioning about six times,"" the 54-year-old said. ""The questions were only about co-operation. 'Do you have links with the Ukrainian security services or military?' Then in the end they just suggested that I co-operate with them - to have a think.""   He said beatings by prison guards were a regular feature of life for those held at the detention centre in a former police station in Nova Kakhova.  ""I wasn't hit. Other people were - I heard it every day, but not me,"" he recalled. ""I spoke to two people. One was an elderly man who was once an ambulance driver in the Donbas military operation zone. He was hit.""  Another man in the cell next to him was ""beaten badly during the first few days"" of his detention, he added.  Mr Vasyliev said in most cases there was no reason or purpose behind the beatings. They were carried out ""just because"", he said.  On his final day in detention, he said the prison officials revealed to him they were officers with Russia's internal security service, the FSB. Other Ukrainians abducted by Russian forces have similarly alleged the FSB was involved in their arrests.  In March, Viktoriia Roshchyna, a journalist with Ukrainian media outlet Hromadske, said she had been abducted and interrogated by FSB officers in the occupied city of Berdyansk.  The UN has told the BBC it has documented many cases of FSB officers taking part in the ""detention, torture and ill-treatment"" of Ukrainian civilians. Both Oleh Pylypenko and Dmytro Vasilyev remain free, though Mr Pylypenko continues to work on the front line of the conflict delivering aid to his constituents.  But dozens of Ukrainian officials remain in custody.  In a short statement, Ukraine's ministry of defence called the detention and torture of local politicians ""shameful"" and said all allegations must be investigated urgently.  ""Russia should bear the brunt of responsibility,"" it added. Russia's defence ministry did not respond to requests for comment on the allegations. The Russian government has previously denied carrying out war crimes in Ukraine. Ukraine's prosecutor general has said her office is receiving 200-300 reports of war crimes a day but cannot investigate every case ""properly and effectively"" because of a lack of access.

What sanctions are being imposed on Russia over Ukraine invasion?,"Thu, 24 Mar 2022 11:41:20 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60125659,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60125659?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Western nations have imposed severe sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.,"The US, UK and EU have announced new sanctions on Russia, two years after its invasion of Ukraine. The measures also marked a week since the death in custody of opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Sanctions are penalties imposed by one country on another, to stop them acting aggressively or breaking international law. They are among the toughest measures nations can take, short of going to war.  Announcing 500 new sanctions against Russia, US President Joe Biden said they would target Russia's war machine. Export restrictions will be imposed on nearly 100 firms or individuals. President Biden said the measures would also target people connected with the imprisonment of Mr Navalny, who died in an Arctic penal camp.  The UK has frozen the assets of six bosses at the prison and banned them from travelling to the UK.  The UK has also imposed new bans on Russian metal, diamond and energy exports. The EU has announced sanctions on 200 organisations and people which it says are helping Russia acquire weapons, or taking Ukrainian children from their homes.  The sanctions include companies and individuals involved in shipping North Korean armaments to Russia. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the US, UK and EU, along with countries including Australia, Canada and Japan, have imposed more than 16,500 sanctions on Russia. Their main target has been Russia's money. Foreign currency reserves worth $350bn (Â£276bn) - about half its total reserves - were frozen. About 70% of the assets of Russian banks were also frozen, the EU says, and some were excluded from Swift, a high-speed messaging service for financial institutions. Western nations have also: Russia's oil industry has been another major target. The US and UK banned Russian oil and natural gas. The EU has banned seaborne crude imports. The G7 - an organisation of the world's seven largest ""advanced"" economies - has imposed a maximum price of $60 (Â£47) a barrel on Russian crude oil, to try to reduce its earnings. Hundreds of major firms, including McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Starbucks and Heineken, have stopped selling and making goods in Russia.  However, some still do business in Russia.  PepsiCo, for example, has been accused of continuing to sell food products in Russia. And the BBC discovered that US cosmetics firm Avon was making goods in a factory near Moscow. President Vladimir Putin has claimed European sanctions have done Russia no harm, saying: ""We have growth, and they have decline."" Russia has managed to sell oil abroad for more than the G7's price cap, according to the Atlantic Council, a US think tank. It says a ""shadow fleet"" of about 1,000 tankers is used to ship it. The International Energy Agency says Russia is still exporting 8.3 million barrels of oil a day - having increased supplies to India and China. Russia is also able to import many sanctioned Western goods by buying them through countries such as Georgia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, according to researchers at King's College London.  China has been a vital supplier of alternative hi-tech products to those produced in the West, says Dr Maria Snegovaya from the US think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""China sells it chips and other components it needs to for keep its military production going,"" she says. ""Russia wouldn't be able to pull that off without China's help."" In 2022, the first year of the war, Russia's economy shrank by 2.1%, according to the International Monetary Fund. However, it estimates that Russia's economy grew by 2.2% in 2023 and predicts growth of 1.1% in 2024. Nevertheless, the US Treasury claims sanctions are damaging Russia, having cut 5% from the economic growth it might have had over the past two years. But Dr Snegovaya suggests: ""Sanctions have not made waging this war sufficiently costly for Russia, and that means it can continue with it for some time to come"". The US Treasury also says that the war in Ukraine and sanctions have led more than a million people - many of them young and highly educated - to leave Russia.  Russia's government has also been slashing health spending to fund the war in Ukraine, according to the UK's Ministry of Defence.  ""This mainly hits people in rural areas,"" says James Nixey of foreign affairs think tank Chatham House. ""The government makes cuts there rather than in the major cities, where they might cause uprisings.""

Climate change: 'We're making wine in Norway',"Sat, 16 Apr 2022 23:47:33 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61093929,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61093929?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Vineyards are moving further north, but new winemakers say they struggle to be taken seriously.","Norwegian winemaker BjÃ¸rn Bergum talks to his grapevines.   ""You have to have a connection with them. When I woke up this morning, there was 3cm of snow. I was saying to them: 'Don't be afraid - it will be nice in the afternoon.'""  Perhaps BjÃ¸rn's plants do need a little extra encouragement; they're growing at 61 degrees north of the equator - far outside the 30-50 degrees latitude traditionally considered optimum for wine production.  But climate change is pushing vineyards further north and south towards the poles.  The trends are absolutely clear, according to Dr Greg Jones, a climatologist who specialises in grape production and wines and is himself the owner of a winery, Abacela, in Oregon in the US.  ""A lot of our cool climate limits have changed. They've gone further north in the northern hemisphere, and further south in the southern hemisphere.  Slinde Vineyard, which Bjorn runs with his partner Halldis, is at the furthest reaches of these new limits.  Positioned by the Sognefjord, Norway's longest and deepest fjord, the vines grow on slopes which catch the sun while facing snow-capped mountains.  BjÃ¸rn remembers the fjord freezing over in winter during his childhood, but he says that never happens now. He's noticed other changes in the weather over the years.   ""I can see when it's raining, it's raining more, but when it's warm, it's warmer too.""  While he worries about the state of the planet and in own country, he acknowledges that, as a wine producer, climate change is working in his favour.  That said, it is still a challenge to produce wine this far north.  BjÃ¸rn says it takes a particular kind of hard work and dedication.  ""I do everything for my 2,700 babies. I'll stay up in the night if I need to, to help them to survive if a frost is coming.""  He works with a variety of grapes to create blends that have tropical notes and a minerality that he says comes from the clay soil.  A secret ingredient is the special quality of the light this far north.  ""We have got a lot of light here. That's our advantage. And we have chilly nights. And we have also got the sun from the reflections from the fjord into the steep hillside. ""So the grapes, the leaves, take up a lot of aromas and absorb them into the skin and we take them out again, to make nice wines.""  But it's not easy convincing everyone that Norwegian wine is worth sampling, BjÃ¸rn says.  ""We have got some people telling us: 'Don't tell anyone, but I have never tasted a wine like this. It's really good - maybe the best I've ever tasted.' ""But they don't dare to tell it when they go back to Germany or other countries because I think they want to mingle with the society within wines, and then it's not very good to tell they've tasted a really good Norwegian wine.""  Having won gold medals in Norwegian wine competitions BjÃ¸rn is keen to try for some international medals, but says he suspects he'll only stand a chance if the judging is blind.   ""If they knew the wine came from Norway, they would probably not taste it at all. But when it's blind tasting they have to taste it and you will get what you deserve, I think.""  BjÃ¸rn and Halldis plan to go commercial this year. It's early days and they still have a lot to prove, but BjÃ¸rn believes they're forging a whole new wine-making frontier in Norway - with five growers existing within a 20km radius.  ""We have now established a winegrowing team here in Sognefjord. It's only 20,000 vines, but it's starting up and I think within five or 10 years, we will probably have a little wine district.""   But while climate change may be providing an opportunity for producers in previously unchartered territory, it's providing a serious challenge for those in many of the world's more established wine-making regions.  ""I did an analysis of 25 of the top places in the world, growing grapes, looking at their long term historical temperature data,"" says Dr Jones ""And every single place warmed during their growing season. And during the winters, there were no places that were not warming, there were no places that were cooling.""   In Bordeaux, this changing climate is palpable, according to the owner of Chateau George 7 in Fronsac, Sally Evans.   ""We've had three spring frosty periods in the last five years since I've been here. And before that, probably they hadn't had one for 20 or 30 years. So these extreme climatic events seem to be more and more common. And that is what is difficult.""  She says global rising temperatures can also be tasted in a glass of wine.  ""When you've got warmer temperatures, the fruit ripens and there's a lot more sugar in the grapes, which gives you higher alcohol when you ferment. The alcohol in wine probably has increased by about two degrees over the last 30 years.  ""The sun and the warmth also impacts the acidity of the wine. You need the acidity for the freshness and the overall balance.""  Hot, dry summers can also impair the flavour of the fruit, she says.   The Bordeaux wine region has introduced new grape varieties which are more suited to these conditions, but Sally says they will take a generation to grow and mature.  In the meantime, she says winemakers are adapting - pruning late to avoid Spring frosts and managing the leaf canopy to shade grapes from the hot sun.   And she says consumers and producers alike will have to accept that some established wines will have a different character in the future.  ""What is typical in 30 years may not be worse, in terms of quality - it may even be better - but it may not be the same profile as a wine now.""  Climate change means producers need to adapt to survive, she says.  ""I think we'll be seeing in the next five or 10 years, just how that is impacting people and their livelihoods here in Bordeaux.

ScotRail: Why have hundreds of trains been cancelled?,"Mon, 23 May 2022 13:51:26 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-61553938,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-61553938?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,About 700 daily services have been axed in Scotland in a dispute between unions and rail bosses.,"Hundreds of trains have been cancelled in Scotland, after operator ScotRail issued a temporary timetable that cut daily services by a third. It comes amid a pay dispute between ScotRail bosses and railway unions, where drivers have declined to work overtime or on rest days. ScotRail does not have enough drivers to run normal services, so without drivers working overtime, trains have been cut across the country. About 700 train services a day were axed on Monday 23 May. ScotRail's original Summer 2022 timetable had about 2,150 weekday services. This has now been reduced to 1,456 in the temporary timetable. Under ScotRail's previous operator Abellio, services peaked at more than 2,400 trains every weekday. This was an increase of 9% a decade earlier. But when the Covid pandemic hit in March 2020, services were reduced as passenger numbers plummeted by 95%. Thousands of people swapped their daily commute for home working. ScotRail reinstated 150 services in its summer timetable, but said peak-time commuter services would not return to pre-pandemic levels. ScotRail is back in public ownership for the first time in 25 years, after Abellio had its franchise ended early amid criticism of the quality of the service. A Scottish government owned company took over the running of ScotRail last month. But this coincided with a driver pay dispute.  Train drivers' union Aslef is balloting members for strike action after rejecting a 2.2% pay offer. The RMT union, which covers other rail workers, then also announced it would hold a strike ballot over pay. ScotRail began cancelling hundreds of trains from Sunday 8 May after many drivers chose not to work overtime or on rest days. About 300 services had been cancelled on Sundays before the new temporary timetable was announced. The operator had relied on drivers working extra hours, due to delays in training new staff during the pandemic. ScotRail said that without the Covid impact on training, it would have trained about an extra 130 drivers. Passengers travelling on the earliest trains of the day and using evening services will be worst hit. Evening trains on routes across the country now terminate hours earlier. Last trains on many services now depart before 20:00, whereas before this could be after 23:00 or near midnight.  Many daily workers are concerned they will struggle to get home using the rail network. Hospitality and entertainment businesses have also warned the situation will affect their income, with passengers unable to get into towns and city centres. The Night Time Industries Association Scotland described the cuts as devastating, and said it was a ""cruel blow"" while businesses were trying to recover after the pandemic. A typical ScotRail driver salary is more than Â£50,000. With drivers being offered a 2.2% pay rise and the opportunity to participate in a revenue share arrangement, the Scottish government says this would take the total package to 5%. Aslef rejected this offer. The RMT union, which had agreed a backdated pay rise of 2.5% in October, also declined the year's deal. After UK inflation jumped to 9% in the 12 months to April, the highest for 40 years, Aslef called for ScotRail to put a ""more realistic"" deal on the table. The union's Scottish organiser, Kevin Lindsay, said: ""I appreciate other sectors and other workers may not be on the same salaries, but this isn't a race to the bottom, my job is to protect the terms and conditions of train drivers."" Scotland's employment minister Richard Lochhead urged workers to be ""sensible"" when asking for pay rises. And ScotRail service delivery director, David Simpson, said the unions' demands were ""just not sustainable in the current economic climate of the railway"".   First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she hoped the train timetable would get back to normal ""as quickly as possible"". But this would require a swift resolution to the pay dispute or new drivers completing their training - which is expected to take months. ScotRail said a full timetable could return if drivers offered to return to previous levels of rest-day working.  It also said the training scheme was ""going very well"" with 130 new drivers going through the programme.   Scotland's transport minister Jenny Gilruth said she expected 38 new drivers to be qualified by the end of the summer, 55 by the end of 2022, and 100 by June 2023. She also said rest day working for drivers was ""outdated"" and that as new owners, the Scottish government was seeking to phase it out. ScotRail have offered little clarity for passengers who have tickets to major concerts, festivals and sporting events. But the RMT warned it would target industrial action around the Edinburgh Festival in August. The union's Scotland organiser told The Sunday Post newspaper: ""We would deliberately target the Edinburgh Festival because that's where the impact is going be."" During the month-long festival, passenger numbers from Edinburgh can increase by 50% during the week and double at weekends. Before the pandemic, ScotRail had run extra trains between Edinburgh and Glasgow every night of the festival, with services until after midnight. There is also concern about football matches at Hampden - with Scotland's World Cup play-off semi-final against Ukraine on Wednesday 1 June. Scottish Conservative transport spokesman, Liam Kerr MSP, said: ""ScotRail must ensure the tens of thousands of fans attending can get home that night. ""It's unacceptable that the last trains to Aberdeen, Dundee and Perth leave before the match has even kicked off."" ScotRail said travel advice for upcoming Scotland internationals would be issued in the lead-up to the games. Do you have a question about the new ScotRail timetable?

Sue Gray report: The unanswered questions about Downing Street parties,"Wed, 25 May 2022 17:21:45 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/61583019,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/61583019?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The report provided more information about gatherings but still left some questions unanswered.,"Senior civil servant Sue Gray has published her full report into gatherings and parties at Downing Street when Covid restrictions were in force. It has provided more information about what went on, but there are still a number of unanswered questions. One of the gatherings investigated by Ms Gray and the Metropolitan police was in the No 10 flat. The Mail on Sunday said it was a ""victory party"" to mark Dominic Cummings leaving the government. It reported that Abba songs including The Winner Takes It All were heard being played loudly in the flat that evening, along with sounds of dancing. However Ms Gray describes it as a ""meeting to discuss the handling of the departures"" of Mr Cummings and the No 10 Director of Communications, Lee Cain. Five (unnamed) special advisers attended and there was food and alcohol. The prime minister joined them at 20:00 and ""the discussion carried on later into the evening"". Sue Gray says the ""information collected on this gathering is limited"" as it was halted when the Met investigation started and adds that, after the Met concluded its investigation, ""I considered whether or not to conduct any further investigation into this event but concluded it was not appropriate or proportionate to do so."" She does not explain why she concluded it was not appropriate or proportionate to continue to look into this event.  Asked by an MP to give further details about what went on in the flat, Mr Johnson refused. There was some confusion earlier in the week about who had requested a meeting between Boris Johnson and Sue Gray. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke had told BBC News that it was Sue Gray who asked for it, but the prime minister's spokesperson later conceded that it had actually been the idea of Downing Street officials. There have also been questions about what was said at this meeting. The suggestion that he had asked for it not to be published came from an article in the Times in which a source said: ""He asked her is there much point in doing it now that it's all out there?"" Mr Johnson was first asked by Conservative MP Aaron Bell whether the Times story was true. Mr Johnson did not directly address the question. Later he was asked by Labour MP Karin Smyth ""did he ask her not to publish the report?"" Mr Johnson replied ""no"". Mr Johnson was also asked about this in the press conference and said: ""The terms of reference make it absolutely clear that Sue has got to publish a report."" Asked by Labour MP Wayne David ""Were any changes made, following requests, to the section relating to the gathering in the No 10 flat on 13 November 2020?"" Mr Johnson said he had already addressed that issue. The event for which the prime minister was fined was the gathering for his birthday on 19 June 2020. It took place in the Cabinet Room with sandwiches, snacks, soft drinks and beer laid out on the table.  The report says that Simon Case, who is now the UK's top civil servant, ""attended for a short period having arrived early for a meeting which was due to take place in the Cabinet room"". And it says that: ""The chancellor was also there briefly having also arrived early for the same meeting."" Yet Rishi Sunak was fined by police for attending the party and Simon Case was not. Both of them appear in the photos of the event in the report.  The report says that special adviser Cleo Watson had been ""asked to organise the event"" for the prime minister's birthday. But it does not say who asked her to organise it. Newspapers have reported that it was the prime minister's then fiancee Carrie Symonds. The prime minister is not mentioned in the report when it talks about the organisation of any of the events. But some of the people involved in the messages and e-mails about them were his closest advisers, including his communications chief Lee Cain, principal private secretary Martin Reynolds and top aide Dominic Cummings. For example, before the ""bring your own booze"" garden party on 20 May Mr Cain emailed Mr Reynolds and Mr Cummings saying: ""I'm sure it'll be fine -and I applaud the gesture - but a 200 odd person invitation for drinks in the garden of no 10 is somewhat of a comms risk in the current environment."" Is it possible that one of them mentioned this to Mr Johnson? In the account of the gathering in the garden at Downing Street on 15 May, the report talks about a number of groups appearing in a photograph in the Guardian. There was a table on the terrace with Boris Johnson, his wife, Martin Reynolds and Dominic Cummings. There is a group including the health secretary and Downing Street and Department of Health officials. And finally: ""There is a further group of four individuals sitting at a table on the terrace. It has not been possible to identify these individuals."" Who could they be? What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

A one-off Bob Dylan recording could sell for £1m,"Tue, 05 Jul 2022 23:50:45 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-62054616,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-62054616?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,A new version of the star's 1960s classic Blowin' In The Wind is expected to make £1m at auction.,"A one-off Bob Dylan record is expected to fetch up to Â£1m when it is auctioned at Christie's on Thursday. The disc features a new version of the star's classic song Blowin' In The Wind, made in March 2021 with his long-time collaborator T Bone Burnett.  ""It felt holy,"" he tells BBC News. ""It always feels holy for me, playing with Bob - and I think we did it in one take, if I'm not mistaken."" It is the first new studio recording of the song since Dylan wrote it in 1962. The one-off release also showcases a new type of record that combines some of the materials used in CDs and vinyl, and promises better sound quality and durability than vinyl. Playable on any regular turntable, the new format is described as ""the pinnacle of sound"" by Burnett, who helped develop it. Ultimately, only one deep-pocketed Dylan fan will get to own the new version of Blowin' In The Wind. However, fans can go to Christie's in London to hear the record before it is sold. There, they will be ushered into a sedate side-room of the auction house, where the 10-inch disc is handled with silk gloves before being placed on a Â£30,000 hi-fi system.  Listening on headphones, the warmth and precision of the sound is immediately apparent, save for a few pops and cracks (maybe four in total) attributable to dust or static on the surface of the record. Dylan's voice is smooth and dextrous throughout, having benefitted from an extended break in touring during the Covid-19 pandemic.  When it appears, his characteristic rasp only adds to the weight of the lyrics, which are inextricably linked to the civil rights movement of the 1960s.  Lines like, ""How many times can a man turn his head / and pretend that he just doesn't see?"" resonate harder than ever when sung from the perspective of an 81-year-old who's witnessed history repeat decade after decade after decade. As a result, the song becomes more contemplative, a rumination on our failures. Dylan stretches out his syllables as though he's contemplating every line anew; taking almost a minute longer to reach the song's conclusion. Allow YouTube content?

Unlike the original, the 2021 re-recording features a full band, recorded live in the studio as Dylan sang. Their subtle and sympathetic arrangement - with Greg Leisz on mandolin and Don Was on bass - adds a new dimension to the song, without stealing focus from the message. It almost seems a shame that, in the words of the Christie's catalogue, ""this is the only copy of Bob Dylan's 2021 recording,.... that will ever be manufactured. No other versions of this recording will be released or sold"". ""We're only making one because we view this work as the equivalent of an oil painting,"" says Burnett, who is best known for his Grammy-winning work on Raising Sand by Alison Kraus and Robert Plant, as well as the soundtracks for O Brother, Where Art Thou? and The Big Lebowski. He hopes that future releases in the format will ""help develop a music space in the fine arts"", allowing artists to combat ""the devaluing of our work by the commoditisation of the internet"". ""I don't know what an original recording of Bob Dylan singing one of the most important songs of the last century is [worth] today, but I know it's not $0.001 divided by 5 billion, which is the reality that musicians face now."" The exclusivity of the new recording has informed its estimated sale price of between Â£600,000 and Â£1 million.  Peter Klarnet, Christie's senior specialist in Americana, says it was hard to calculate an estimate, as nothing of this nature has ever been sold before. The closest analogy is the Wu-Tang Clan album Once Upon a Time in Shaolin, which was limited to a single CD copy in 2015. That record was initially bought by hedge fund manager Martin Shkreli for an unspecified sum. When he was later convicted of fraud, the US Department of Justice re-sold the album for a reported $4m (Â£3.35m), making it the most expensive work of music ever sold. Klarnet says he is unsure whether the Dylan could match that figure, but suggests his initial estimate is on the conservative side. Meanwhile, Burnett is enthused by the potential of his new physical audio format - known as an Ionic Original. Announced in April, it consists of ""lacquer painted onto an aluminium disc, with a spiral etched into it by music"".  This is essentially the same technology that the music industry has used for decades to create test pressings, known as acetates or dubplates. Musicians generally agree that these acetates sound better than vinyl - but they degrade quickly, as the force of the needle pushing into the groove melts the lacquer. ""So we started looking into what they use on the Space Station to shield it from the direct light of the sun,"" says Burnett. ""And we've been able to coat the acetate with that, and it removes enough friction that the acetate doesn't degrade over thousands of plays."" He says the coating - made from a gradient of sapphire and quartz - also reduces the crackle associated with vinyl. ""Friction creates static electricity, which attracts dust, which causes pops,"" he explains. ""So with this coating removing friction, if some dust does land on the needle, it cleans it out. So the discs are essentially self-cleaning."" At the time of writing, the discs cannot be mass produced, meaning they are likely to remain collector's items and investment opportunities for now. But Burnett hopes they will be widely adopted in the future. ""I don't look at this as a replacement for anything,"" he says. ""I just look at it as another arrow in the quiver for every musician in the world [and] a whole new way of earning a living that we've never had before."" This isn't Burnett's first venture into audio formats. In 2008, he developed a hi-fidelity technology known as Î§ÎÎÎ (or Code), which allowed listeners to play ""studio quality"" recordings from a DVD player.  Releases on the format included John Mellencamp's Life, Death, Love and Freedom - but the format died out relatively quickly. Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

Rugby League World Cup: Tonga 32-6 Wales - Tonga cruise to victory after early scare,"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 20:25:44 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/63378130,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/63378130?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Tonga put one foot in the Rugby League World Cup quarter-finals but are made to work hard before beating a gutsy Wales side 32-6.,"This video can not be played Wales v Tonga highlights Rugby League World Cup 2021 Tonga (16) 32 Tries: Tupou 3, Fifita, Koloamatangi, Niu Goals: Lolohea 3, Talakai Wales (6) 6 Try: Evans Goal: Fozard Tonga put one foot in the Rugby League World Cup quarter-finals but were made to work hard by a gutsy Wales side. Wales initially rattled Tonga at St Helens and led for most of the first half thanks to Kyle Evans' fine try. But after Daniel Tupou crossed to get Tonga going, two quick tries just before half-time from David Fifita and Keaon Koloamatangi put them in charge. Tonga clicked into gear after the break, with Tupou completing his hat-trick around a Tesi Niu try. A win over Cook Islands in their final pool game next week will confirm Tonga as Group D winners and a quarter-final game against the Group A runners up - likely to be either Samoa or France, with hosts England set to top the group if they win their final match against bottom side Greece. Wales' hopes, meanwhile, are hanging by a thread having already lost their opener to Cook Islands five days ago as they continue to search for a first win at a World Cup since 2000. To have any chance of remaining in this tournament, John Kear's side need Papua New Guinea to beat Cook Islands on Tuesday night and then manage to pull off a shock result against PNG in their final group encounter in Doncaster next Monday. Cook Islands edge Wales in opening thriller Wales at the World Cup: Feast and famine 'If it bursts you will probably die' - World Cup caps Walker return Clive Sullivan: Rugby league legend Fixtures, results and BBC coverage times Kear freshened up his side by bringing Gavin Bennion, Kyle Evans, James Olds and Luke Thomas into his 19-man match squad in place of Will Evans, Rhodri Lloyd, Mike Butt and the injured Ben Evans - out of the competition with a throat injury. Tonga welcomed back Konrad Hurrell but were again without the injured Will Hopoate and captain Jason Taumalolo, who is suspended until the final group game. Kristian Woolf's side were again playing at the Totally Wicked Stadium, his home-from-home since 2020 where he coached St Helens to the club's first Challenge Cup in 13 years plus three successive Grand Final victories. Wales entered Woolf's den as huge underdogs, with their largely semi-professional pool of players fronting up to a Mate Ma'a Tonga outfit packed full of NRL and Super League talent. This video can not be played 'Could you have called it wrong?' - Special Tongan try ruled out After Tonga laid down a stirring Sipi Tau, Kasey Badger - making history by becoming the first woman to referee a men's Rugby League World Cup game - blew her whistle to begin what was a first meeting between the two nations at any level of rugby league. Wales started sloppily, putting themselves under pressure with poor handling and poor discipline, but survived and then clicked to cross the tryline first - only for Dalton Grant to be held up in the tackle by Talatau Amone and Niu. But there was no denying Kear's side when wing Evans put in a crunching tackle to knock the ball free and then scamper away to the line from Josh Ralph's well-timed pass, with Matty Fozard converting. Evans is a recent convert to league from union, with just three games for Wakefield Trinity under his belt, but underlined his potential in the 13-man code with a high-class performance against high-class opposition. Tonga, stung, soon replied to put Tupou over on the left with a swift passage of passes from a scrum, but Tuimoala Lolohea missed the tricky kick at goal. Woolf's side should have taken the lead when Sione Katoa broke through on the right, but the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks wing juggled the pass before letting the ball slip through his grasp. Kasey Badger took charge of Tonga v Wales to make history as the first woman to referee a men's Rugby League World Cup game Wales put their bodies on the line as Tonga upped their intensity, but conceded two tries minutes before half-time that turned the match on its head. First Fifita worked a mismatch against Ollie Olds to just break the whitewash, before Koloamatangi seized on a disjointed defensive line to go over.  Lolohea kicked both goals to give Tonga a 16-6 advantage at half-time. Niu showed stepping prowess and power to break Wales' sliding defence for the second half's opening try and Tonga's fourth of the night - with Lolohea again on target with the kick. Joe Burke did brilliantly to get two hands under the ball as Lolohea tried to dot down, but it was only a temporary reprieve as Wales ran out of numbers on their right to allow Tupou in for his second of the night. A smudge of sideline whitewash prevented Toluta'u Koula conjuring what would have been a sensational try for Lolohea, the interchange diving to scoop a kick back into the arms of his waiting half-back - the video referee's no-try decision attracting good-natured boos from the crowd. But as Wales tired, pride and bravery were not enough to keep Tonga at bay and Tupou completed his hat-trick, with Siosifa Talakai taking over kicking duties to add a further two points. An obstruction denied Tupou a fourth, but the Sydney Roosters winger had already secured his player of the match award. Wales suffered further disappointment with a late shoulder injury to Olds that could potentially rule the stand-off out of next week's Papua New Guinea showdown. Tonga coach Kristian Woolf: ""It's a little bit like last week, we've got a bit of improvement in us - we left a lot of points out there tonight just with our basic catch-pass and execution. ""But I thought we defended really well, we gave up one try with the ball there being a bit loose, so I think our discipline with the ball was a little bit of an issue for us all night. ""We looked like we thought it was going to be easier than it was I suppose, and you tend to get a lesson when you go out there thinking like that."" Wales coach John Kear: ""I don't think it [the scoreline] does us justice. The players are all heart aren't they and you've got to take your hat off to them. ""They commit totally against a big, physical, good rugby league team and again I'm proud of them but we've lost, we're in defeat but the resilience is tremendous. ""We've got to realise they're the full-time outfit. We're playing an NRL team - and a good NRL team - and that's why I'm so pleased with our effort."" Tonga: 22. Tesi Niu, 2. Daniel Tupou, 3.

Twitter to make job cuts after Elon Musk takeover,"Fri, 04 Nov 2022 01:56:13 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-63495125,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-63495125?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The social media giant says staff will be told on Friday whether they are to be laid off.,"Twitter staff have started to post online that they believe they have lost their jobs, ahead of an announcement by the company later on Friday. The social media giant says it will inform its staff whether they are still employed after Elon Musk's takeover. Employees are tweeting using the hashtag #LoveWhereYouWorked and a saluting emoji to say they are leaving. Yash Agarwal, who worked in public policy, said it was ""the greatest privilege ever"" to work for Twitter. In an internal email, the social media company said the cuts are ""an effort to place Twitter on a healthy path"". The firm added that its offices would be temporarily closed, with staff unable to enter the building until they know if they have lost their jobs. The multi-billionaire will be Twitter's chief executive after buying the firm last week in a $44bn (Â£39.3bn) deal. ""We will go through the difficult process of reducing our global workforce on Friday,"" Twitter said in the email. ""We recognise this will impact a number of individuals who have made valuable contributions to Twitter, but this action is unfortunately necessary to ensure the company's success moving forward,"" it added. The company said office access would be immediately limited ""to help ensure the safety of each employee as well as Twitter systems and customer data"". All staff are set to receive an email with the subject ""Your Role at Twitter"" by 09:00 Pacific time (16:00 GMT) on Friday. Workers who are not affected will be notified through their company email, according to Twitter.  Meanwhile, those who are affected will be told of the ""next steps"" through their personal accounts. ""Given the nature of our distributed workforce and our desire to inform impacted individuals as quickly as possible, communications for this process will take place via email,"" Twitter said. There is speculation that as many as half of Twitter's 8,000 jobs are on the chopping block. The platform struggles to make a profit. One way to fix the problem is by making a dent in the wage bill. Simon Balmain, a senior community manager for Twitter in the UK, told the BBC that he believed he has been laid off, because he was logged out of his work laptop and Slack messaging programme. ""Everyone got an email saying that there was going to be a large reduction in headcount, and then around an hour later, folks started getting their laptops remotely wiped and access to Slack and Gmail revoked,"" he said. ""Most UK folks are probably asleep and don't know yet. I was working mostly LA (Los Angeles) hours because of the projects I was on, so was still awake when it happened."" Another Twitter worker said he was anxiously waiting for an email to arrive, confirming whether he still had a job. He said he would probably stay up late to wait for the message. ""The exodus of talent from this lay-off will reshape the whole technology industry as we know it. We're all looking out for each other and the outreach of love and support has been incredible to see,"" Mr Balmain said.  Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources, suggested some senior staff were asked to make lists of employees to be cut on their teams.  Cryptocurrency platform Binance invested in Twitter as part of Mr Musk's takeover. Earlier, Changpeng Zhao, its chief executive, said that ""a slimmer workforce would make more sense"". Mr Zhao, who was speaking at the Web Summit in Lisbon, also criticised the platform for having been slow to roll out new features, given its level of staffing. The cost-cutting follows criticism of Twitter's efforts to raise money by proposing to charge $8 (Â£7) a month for a ""verified"" blue check-mark. In addition to the verification badge, those who pay could have their tweets promoted more widely and see fewer adverts. Mr Musk has tweeted of his plan: ""We need to pay the bills somehow.""  Twitter has not made a profit in several years and its number of users has remained fairly static at about 300 million a month. Many experts suggest that Mr Musk, the world's richest man, overpaid for the company, given current economic conditions and the depressed values of many tech stocks. But Brandon Borrman, Twitter's former head of global communications, in a BBC interview, questioned how Twitter could justify asking people to pay in order to remain on an ""equal playing field"" with other users. It is not clear how the cuts will affect the platform's operations. Mr Musk has a reputation for being ruthless when it comes to staff. US media reports already speak of long hours spent by some staff to meet Mr Musk's demands in the aftermath of the takeover. In May, Mr Musk said his work ethic expectations would be ""extreme"", but less than he demanded of himself. As part of the takeover agreement, nine members of Twitter's board departed the company, leaving self-styled ""Chief Twit"" Mr Musk as the sole director. The move was seen as cementing Mr Musk's control over the company. Among those leaving were chairman Bret Taylor and chief executive Parag Agrawal.  Other senior figures have also posted about leaving, or are reported to have left, including chief financial officer Ned Segal. As senior figures left, US media reported that a number of Mr Musk's allies joined Twitter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Anthony Ogogo: 'When I started boxing I was an angry little boy',"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 00:47:58 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-suffolk-63265882,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-suffolk-63265882?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Former boxer Anthony Ogogo shares his story from the UK's most easterly point to Olympic success.,"Former boxer Anthony Ogogo was born to a white English mother and a black Nigerian father. Here in his own words, he reflects on his extraordinary journey from growing up in the UK's most easterly point to Olympic success at London 2012. My dad is the reason why I have this beautiful skin. My dad is the reason why I have this amazing last name. But he never taught me anything - he was never here, he was never around. I was born in Lowestoft but my dad was Nigerian, lived most of his life there and came over here [for] education. He wasn't much part of [my] life growing up but my mum knew it was very important for us to have a sense of identity, understand why we look what we look like and why our last name is Ogogo and what that means to us. She instilled that in me, which is weird because my mum is a white lady from Lowestoft, Suffolk.  In my teenage years, I had a lot of anger towards [my dad] - a lot of borderline hatred actually.  We were in Suffolk and he was in London. He would come back at weekends and he'd start on me - he'd tell me off and I'd done nothing wrong.  He'd hit me, my mum would protect me, then he'd argue with my mum and then he'd get in his car and drive away - this happened for a long, long time. As a kid, it felt like they were arguing over me. For my entire life I thought they got divorced because of me, that really messed me up. So, as a teenager I was just focused on me, on boxing and being successful. I saw my mum struggle, I saw her work her backside off to provide for us, so I was very much driven at being successful to make her and my whole family proud. It wasn't until my dad died that I said to myself that I did want to know more about my heritage. He died when I was 23 and I didn't want to go and see him at hospital, didn't want to go to his funeral, that's my one regret in my life. But it wasn't until he died that I realised the hatred had started to dissipate and I was like: ""Do you know what? He was an inspiring man."" He was the oldest of 10 brothers and sisters, he provided for his family, he had a PhD, he was a very good man and ultimately as children we look to our parents like these superhero people. I still do with my mum - but he was just a human and he had his flaws.  Nigeria is a place I've been longing to go back to for years, it was the first country I visited. Lowestoft is the most easterly point in the UK, that's our little tag line, but what that means is it's [difficult] to get to, nobody goes there, it's [difficult] to get from and nobody leaves.  When I was 12 or 13 years old I went to Nigeria and, wow, what a culture shock.  When I started boxing I was an angry little boy. I was in trouble at school a lot of the time, but boxing was the perfect vehicle for me. In boxing, I was a warrior, when the bell went, I went into this place where I was so determined and driven to win. I was a very good footballer but boxing gave me something different that football didn't give me. I loved [the fact that] when I won, I won. When I lost, I lost - I didn't lose because the goalkeeper made a mistake or the left-back wasn't paying attention. I lost because I needed to get better. I had the responsibility and I loved taking control of the situation. But all the cards were stacked against me. I was from a family full of women - my mum and my four sisters - [there was] not one ounce of male testosterone in my life other than the boxing coaches. I was from the most unfashionable town in the country, from an unfashionable county in the country.  Where I'm from, people don't go to the Olympic Games, people don't become successful. Where I'm from, you're a success if you work offshore and earn Â£50,000 a year. If you want to be a sporting star then you come from London, Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester, that path has been walked a thousand times before. When you want to become an international boxing superstar from Lowestoft, Suffolk, it's like: ""How do I even do it?"" I also found I never fitted in anywhere. I was one of a handful of black or brown faces in Lowestoft growing up, I didn't see anybody else like me, other than my sisters. My best friend called me a name when I was four or five years old and that was the first day I realised I was different. I went home, got a flannel and washed my face as hard as I could, I was sobbing. When my mum saw, she asked me what was wrong and she told me: ""You're beautiful, you're brown and don't ever, ever say that again."" Then when I first got on to the England team. I was 14 years old and I travelled down to Crystal Palace with my bags on the train. [It was] a four-hour journey to get there.  I finally got there and thought I'm now going to make some friends, some black friends, people like me.  I turned up and there was a little group of black boys and I thought I had found my community. It was 2003 and England had just won the Rugby World Cup; I didn't know anything about rugby but we watched the final, I knew we won and my mum bought me a rugby shirt.  So there's me, wearing my rugby shirt, proud as punch, and they were like ""do you like rugby?"" and I went ""yeah, I guess"" and they chuckled and walked off. Then I realised rugby is a white, posh person's sport. I had no idea. So it transpired I was too black for the white kids and too white for the black kids. I just didn't fit in anywhere and that was hard for me. But from that moment, I made a vow to myself then that if I'm not going to fit in and I'm going to stand out anyway - watch how much I stand out, watch what I do with my life.

Crimea bridge: Putin accuses Ukraine of 'terrorism',"Sun, 09 Oct 2022 19:18:51 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-63195504,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-63195504?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Vladimir Putin accuses Ukraine of attacking the bridge to Crimea, saying it was an ""act of terrorism"".","This video can not be played Watch: The moment explosion hits Crimea bridge Russian President Vladimir Putin has accused Ukraine of attacking the bridge to Russian-annexed Crimea, saying that it was an ""act of terrorism"". President Putin said Ukraine's intelligence forces had aimed to destroy a critically important piece of Russia's civil infrastructure. He was speaking at a meeting with the head of the Investigative Committee of Russia, Alexander Bastrykin. Officials say three people were killed in the blast on the bridge. The victims were in a nearby car when a lorry blew up, Russian officials say. ""There is no doubt, this is an act of terrorism aimed at destroying Russia's critical civilian infrastructure,"" Mr Putin said. ""Its authors, perpetrators and beneficiaries are the security services of Ukraine."" Mr Bastrykin said that citizens of Russia and some foreign states had aided preparations for the attack.   According to Mr Bastrykin, investigators have established that the truck which they say blew up travelled through Bulgaria, Georgia, Armenia, North Ossetia and Krasnodar Territory. He has ordered an investigation into the incident which brought down sections of the roadway.  Ukrainian officials have not indicated that their forces were behind the attack. But an adviser to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, Mykhailo Podolyak, denied Mr Putin's accusation.  He wrote that there is ""only one terrorist state here"" and that the ""whole world knows who it is"".  ""Does Putin accuse Ukraine of terrorism? It looks too cynical even for Russia,"" he said.  On Saturday, President Volodymyr Zelensky acknowledged the incident in his nightly address, saying: ""Today was not a bad day and mostly sunny on our state's territory."" ""Unfortunately, it was cloudy in Crimea. Although it was also warm,"" he added. Russian authorities partially re-opened the roadway part of the bridge hours after the attack but for light traffic only. The railway part of the bridge - where oil tankers caught fire - has also reopened. The 19km (12-mile) bridge, the longest in Europe, is an important supply route for Russian forces fighting in Ukraine. Russia has used the bridge to move military equipment, ammunition, and personnel from Russia to battlefields in southern Ukraine. It was opened by Mr Putin in 2018, four years after Russia's annexation of Crimea. Security camera footage released on social media showed a truck - allegedly from the Russian city of Krasnodar, an hour's drive from the crossing - moving west across the bridge at the time of the explosion. The footage shows a huge fireball erupting just behind - and to one side - of the truck as it begins to climb an elevated section of the bridge. The speed with which the truck bomb theory started to spread in Russian circles was suspicious. It suggested the Kremlin preferred an act of terrorism to a more alarming possibility: that this was an audacious act of sabotage carried out by Ukraine. ""I've seen plenty of large vehicle-borne IEDs [improvised explosive devices] in my time,"" a former British army explosives expert told me. ""This does not look like one."" A more plausible explanation, he said, is a massive explosion below the bridge - probably delivered using some kind of clandestine maritime drone. ""Bridges are generally designed to resist downwards loads on the deck and a certain amount of side loading from the wind,"" he said. ""They are not generally engineered to resist upward loads. I think this fact was exploited in the Ukrainian attack."" Some observers have noted that in one of the other security camera videos, something that looks like the bow wave of a small boat appears next to one of the bridge supports, a split second before the explosion.

The Papers: MP 'refuses to quit' and Becker 'to serve time',"Sat, 30 Apr 2022 04:49:50 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-the-papers-61280198,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-the-papers-61280198?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,A Tory MP's suspension over pornography claims and tennis star Boris Becker's jail sentence lead the papers.,"Under the headline ""Porn MP refuses to quit as he loses whip"", the Daily Telegraph reports on growing anger among female Conservative MPs over the way the party has handled claims that their colleague Neil Parish watched pornography on his phone while in the Commons. Dame Caroline Dinenage, who sits on the women and equalities committee, tells the paper she cannot see how his position is sustainable and described the situation as ""just utterly bizarre"". According to the Guardian, Labour is accusing Conservative whips of initially trying to ""cover up"" for Mr Parish, before deciding to suspend him from the parliamentary party. In its leader, the paper speaks of ""a sense of rising anger"" about the way some women are treated in parliament and the ""culture of impunity that continues to surround MPs"". The i reflects on the story with a cartoon of cleaners in the House of Commons spraying the leather benches of the Commons with disinfectant, using the headline: ""A stain on British democracy"". Photographs of Boris Becker are also featured on many of the front pages, following his being jailed for two and a half years for hiding assets to avoid paying debts after declaring bankruptcy. The Times declares his sentence to be the ""fall of a champion"", while the Daily Mirror describes it as the ""downfall of a legend"". The Sun  has a picture of an umpire at Wimbledon, where Becker became the men's champion at the age of 17, declaring ""time!"". In its leader column, The Times suggests his early success sowed the seeds of his eventual demise. ""Plainly he had too much, too young,"" it argues, which ""led to him having not enough when he was no longer young"". Sign up for a morning briefing direct to your inbox. The Daily Mail focuses on calls from senior Tories for the police to further investigate allegations that the Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and his deputy Angela Rayner broke lockdown restrictions at an event in April last year. Sir Keir, who was pictured having a beer at the Durham Miners' Club, has insisted there was no breach of the rules. The Mail, which refers to the saga as ""beergate"", describes the decision by Durham Constabulary not to conduct a more thorough inquiry as ""a shameful dereliction of duty"". The Financial Times warns of what it calls a ""global downturn driven by surging inflation and the Ukraine war"". It says new data suggests that European growth is weaker than expected, the American economy is ""stalling"", and there are deep concerns about the impact of the latest wave of Covid-19 in China.   One economist is quoted as saying the ""world is in really bad shape"", while the FT also reports that Europe is expected to be hit by what's described as a ""double whammy"" of an economic downturn and rising borrowing costs. The Daily Express reveals that loved ones may soon be able to end their video calls with a realistic kiss, thanks to the latest virtual reality technology.  It explains that researchers in the United States have come up with a system which uses highly focussed sound waves, which can be focussed into beams that create sensations on the lips. But the scientists warn that it will take time to perfect because the sensation of kissing is so complex.

Aiden Aslin: Family appeal for safety of Briton 'captured in Ukraine',"Thu, 14 Apr 2022 19:24:48 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-61112299,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-61112299?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Russian sources claim Aiden Aslin has been captured in the besieged city of Mariupol.,"The family of a British man has appealed for him to be treated humanely after he was reportedly captured while defending Ukraine. Russian sources claim Aiden Aslin, who is originally from Newark in Nottinghamshire, has been captured in the besieged city of Mariupol. On Tuesday his family told the BBC his unit was having to prepare to surrender to Russian forces. Mr Aslin has now appeared in photos and video footage restrained in handcuffs. His mother Ang Wood told the BBC: ""I believe it is him in the photographs. We just want him to be treated according to the Geneva Conventions. ""We are just hoping that maybe there can be some sort of prisoner exchange. We don't know what else to do right now except keep pressing the Foreign Office."" The BBC has asked the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) for a response. Mr Aslin has a Ukrainian fiancÃ©e and now has dual citizenship, after moving to Ukraine in 2018. His grandmother Pamela Hall told the BBC: ""I never expected this, I thought if the worst came to the worst that Aiden would die fighting. ""Obviously I didn't want that, I wanted the war to end and for him to go home to his fiancÃ©e."" Mr Aslin had been defending Mariupol with his unit during heavy fighting in recent weeks. ""I think all the guys should be treated as prisoners of war according to the Geneva Conventions; I appreciate it's opposing forces, but they're all human beings,"" his grandmother said. ""We are all just hoping and praying for his safety."" This video can not be played WATCH: Drone footage shows extensive Mariupol shelling damage Mr Aslin is a former care worker who previously fought with Kurdish armed units in Syria against so-called Islamic State. He passed out as a marine with the Ukrainian military in 2018. His family understand his unit is the 36th Marine Brigade. A video is being shown on Russian television news in which Mr Aslin is being questioned.  The interviewer first asks in Russian whether he understands the language, to which he replies in Russian ""50/50"". He is then asked whether he killed anyone, and the interviewer also says: ""Did you see others killing anyone in your presence?"" Mr Aslin replies in English: ""I didn't do any fighting."" By Emma Vardy, BBC News correspondent Aiden Aslin is clearly being used to maximum advantage as a tool for Russian propaganda, interviewed by a Russian TV reporter while being held captive.  In a lengthy segment, the news anchor and reporter refer to Aiden in brutal terms, calling him a ""head cutter"".   During the interview, Aiden appears to back up propaganda that Russian state media has been putting out since the start of the invasion.  He states he has seen Ukrainian soldiers killing Ukrainian civilians. A classic Kremlin claim regularly made by Russian officials, despite huge amounts of evidence of atrocities against civilians committed by Russian forces. We cannot know under what duress Aiden may have been prior to this interview, but one thing is very clear.  These are not the words of the Aiden Aslin from a few weeks ago, when he was speaking to family from the conflict and regularly posting social media updates. Loved ones will tell you he was very proud of his role as a marine in the Ukrainian forces, and believes strongly in defending civilians.  His grandmother told the BBC: ""Aiden was not a mercenary as some of these Russian posts are saying. ""He has never been a mercenary and his involvement with the Ukrainian forces came about because he made Ukraine his adopted home, and he was due to marry his fiancÃ©e. ""It's an unjust war - it should never have happened."" Additional reporting by Olga Ivshina. Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

Three-time Wimbledon champion Becker jailed over bankruptcy,"Fri, 29 Apr 2022 17:52:04 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-61276378,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-61276378?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Ex-Wimbledon star sentenced to two and a half years for hiding assets to avoid paying debts.,"Former Wimbledon champion Boris Becker has been jailed for two and a half years for hiding Â£2.5m worth of assets and loans to avoid paying debts. The 54-year-old six-time Grand Slam champion was found guilty of four charges under the Insolvency Act. The case centred on Becker's bankruptcy in June 2017 resulting from an unpaid loan of more than Â£3m on his luxury estate in Mallorca, Spain. Judge Deborah Taylor said he had shown no remorse or acceptance of guilt.  Referring to Becker's previous conviction for tax evasion in Germany in 2002, she told the former world number one: ""You did not heed the warning you were given and the chance you were given by the suspended sentence and that is a significant aggravating factor... ""You have... sought to distance yourself from your offending and your bankruptcy. ""While I accept your humiliation as part of the proceedings, there has been no humility."" Becker was legally obliged to disclose all of his assets so that his trustee could distribute available funds to his creditors, to whom he owed nearly Â£50m when he was declared bankrupt. But earlier this month, after about two weeks hearing evidence, Southwark Crown Court jurors found Becker guilty of removal of property, two counts of failing to disclose estate and concealing debt. They acquitted him on a further 20 charges, including nine counts of failing to hand over his tennis trophies and medals, including two from Wimbledon.  Prosecutor Rebecca Chalkley said the jury had found the Wimbledon commentator had acted ""deliberately and dishonestly"".  She added: ""Even now, Mr Becker is still seeking to blame others when it was obviously his duty.""

He was also found to have made Â£390,000 worth of payments from his business account to nine others, including those of his ex-wife Barbara and estranged wife Sharlely ""Lilly"" Becker. Becker's barrister Jonathan Laidlaw QC told the court the tennis star's ""fall from grace"" had left ""his reputation in tatters"".  He said: ""Boris Becker has literally nothing and there is also nothing to show for what was the most glittering of sporting careers and that is correctly termed as nothing short of a tragedy. ""These proceedings have destroyed his career entirely and ruined any further prospect of earning an income."" Becker will serve half his sentence on licence.  Boris Becker was catapulted to stardom, aged 17, in 1985 when he became the youngest singles male player to win the Wimbledon Championships.  He went on to win a further two Wimbledon titles, two Australian Opens and one US Open. He also won a gold medal at the Olympics in doubles.  He retired from tennis in 1999, and has since commentated at Wimbledon for the BBC.  In 2013, Mr Becker turned his hand to coaching, working with one of the world's greatest, Novak Djokovic. In their three years together, Djokovic won six Grand Slam titles.  He was also involved in overseeing youth development and the Davis Cup team at the German Tennis Federation until stepping down in 2020. The father-of-four has lived in London since 2012.  Becker had told the jury his career earnings of $50m (about Â£38 million) were spent on an expensive divorce from his first wife in 2001, child maintenance payments, and ""expensive lifestyle commitments"", including his Â£22,000-a-month rented house in Wimbledon, south-west London. The trial also revealed Becker's taste for designer clothes, shopping in Harrods and that he was spending thousands on his children's school fees. He said his income had ""reduced dramatically"" following his retirement in 1999. The prosecution against Becker was brought by the Insolvency Service on behalf of the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Kwasi Kwarteng.  Speaking after the sentencing, its chief executive Dean Beale said: ""Boris Becker's sentence clearly demonstrates that concealing assets in bankruptcy is a serious offence for which we will prosecute and bring offenders to justice."" BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller said after serving his time, the former world number one would probably rebuild his career by making a return to coaching and TV commentating.  David Law of the Tennis Podcast commented tennis fans would still hold affection for Becker. He said: ""Those memories will last, but at the same time this is hugely embarrassing for him... it's prison time and it will follow him and stay with him.""

Review into Nottingham NHS maternity failings launches,"Thu, 01 Sep 2022 00:55:35 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-62737356,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-62737356?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Families are urged to take part in the review being conducted by influential midwife Donna Ockenden.,"A review into failings at a city's NHS maternity units has launched, with a call for affected families to come forward. The review, led by midwife Donna Ockenden, will examine how dozens of babies died or were injured at the Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) trust. Ms Ockenden previously led an inquiry into the UK's biggest maternity scandal at Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Trust. NUH said it welcomed the review. Ms Ockenden said: ""The ultimate aim of this independent review is to make sure the performance at the trust's maternity service improves as quickly as possible and in a way that means those improvements are sustained. ""As with the Shrewsbury review, this review will assess if cases of concern were adequately investigated by the trust at the time, if the lessons for learning were the appropriate ones and whether the lessons were indeed learned and acted upon."" She added she had already met with some of the families and said their accounts were ""absolutely harrowing"". Ms Ockenden said the review was also working hard to reach all communities in the Nottingham area and emphasised it was interested in all experiences, not just the most traumatic where babies had died or been injured. In a statement, Ms Ockenden's team - which consists of about 60 practising NHS maternity experts from across the country - said it was of ""paramount importance"" the review was comprehensive, leaving no voices unheard. ""In order to achieve this, it is essential that Donna and the review team are in contact with as many families and current and former staff in maternity services as possible,"" the statement said. Ms Ockenden said she expected the review would take about 18 months but she planned to share ""learning points"" with the trust during that time. Families, who have called for an independent inquiry for years, have welcomed its launch. Jack and Sarah Hawkins, whose daughter Harriet was stillborn at NUH in 2016 after a series of failings, said the start of the new investigation was a landmark moment. They urged families to take part in the review. Mrs Hawkins said: ""It's an incredible feeling because for so long we've been fighting. ""We feel a massive sense of relief. ""We understand our daughter is dead but there will be people out there with healthy babies who have had failures in their care and we would ask them to come forwards and share their concerns. ""We need to do this, a team effort to get Nottinghamshire safe again for mothers."" Mr Hawkins added: ""It's an independent review, it's what's been needed for a long time and we  welcome it. We are just so pleased."" The couple, who previously worked for the trust, were one of a number of families who lobbied former health secretary Sajid Javid. NHS England appointed Ms Ockenden to lead a review in Nottingham in May 2022, following her previous work investigating the deaths of more than 200 babies at Shrewsbury and Telford. A review was already under way in Nottingham but critics said its remit was too narrow and it was not independent enough. The Nottingham trust was established in 2006 when the management of the Nottingham City Hospital and the Queen's Medical Centre (QMC) merged to form one organisation. Figures obtained by the BBC have found that, between 2005-6 and 2020-21, there were a total of 207 claims against the hospital's maternity services, including 36 for cerebral palsy, 26 for stillbirths and 24 for brain damage. The total amount awarded in damages for that period was more than Â£110m. In December 2020, the trust's maternity services were rated inadequate with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) finding ""several serious concerns"". Michelle Rhodes, chief nurse at NUH, said: ""We are deeply sorry for the unimaginable distress that has been caused due to failings in our maternity services. ""We know that an apology will never be enough and we owe it to those who have been failed, those we're caring for today and to our staff to deliver a better maternity service for our communities. ""We welcome Donna Ockenden and her team to Nottingham and will work with them to achieve this.""  A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Donna Ockenden has brought a wealth of experience, particularly following her work on the review of Shrewsbury and Telford maternity services - and the department looks forward to seeing her recommendations for urgent improvements. ""We will continue to take all the steps necessary to ensure no families have to go through this pain again."" Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

Liverpool: Have Reds struck blow over Manchester City after FA Cup semi-final win?,"Sat, 16 Apr 2022 19:29:33 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61130564,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61130564?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Have Liverpool struck a psychological blow over Manchester City in the race for domestic and European glory with their FA Cup semi-final win?," Last updated on 16 April 202216 April 2022.From the section FA Cup Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp ordered his players to be ""as annoying as possible"" as they chased down Manchester City in the hunt for the silverware that could bring them a historic quadruple. Klopp issued his statement when Liverpool made their attempt to play on City's nerves in a Premier League title race that, at one point, looked to turn into a procession for Pep Guardiola's reigning champions. Liverpool have been as good as their manager's word and they were certainly able to get under City's skin, while receiving a turbocharge in the chase towards history with a 3-2 win in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley. If this heavyweight sporting duel is reaching such a defining phase that almost every incident is forensically investigated to decipher who holds the psychological advantage, this was certainly a strike to Liverpool.  Not a decisive one. City are too good, still in the lead in the title race and have a Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid to come, but a strike nonetheless.   City will not be derailed by a single setback and Guardiola's team selection hinted at the FA Cup not exactly being top of his list of priorities, but Liverpool will take confidence and use this to bolster their own efforts.  Liverpool's supremacy in the first 45 minutes must strengthen belief that City's one-point lead in the league can be overhauled while, with the Carabao Cup secured and a Champions League semi-final against Villarreal to come, the history books beckon.  Klopp may try to keep a lid on the excitement and expectation (or he may not) but there is no escaping reality and there must surely be a feeling inside Liverpool's camp that the so-called impossible might just be possible.  And, to add to the intrigue, City will be Liverpool's most formidable obstacle with title ambitions of their own and that elusive first Champions League win coming tantalisingly into view. These are Europe's two outstanding sides.  If the spectacular 2-2 draw at Etihad Stadium six days before this Wembley meeting set the stage for the climax of the season - where a Champions League final confrontation remains very much a possibility - then this semi-final triumph can be counted as first blood to Liverpool.  If that draw was a game of fine margins when two top-class sides simply could not be separated, here Liverpool overwhelmed City in a first 45 minutes that effectively won the game, no matter that Pep Guardiola's side greatly improved after the break.  Liverpool's physical power and sharpness was too much for a reshaped City. How it showed as Ibrahima Konate brushed aside all challenges to head the first while Sadio Mane pounced on an Ederson-lite calamity from Guardiola's FA Cup keeper Zack Steffen to confirm their superiority.  City looked lost and leggy, Mane's third for Liverpool before half-time providing an advantage that proved decisive despite some late anxiety following City goals from Jack Grealish and Bernardo Silva at either end of the second half.  Klopp's trademark fist pump as Liverpool reached their first FA Cup final for a decade reflected his delight.  Liverpool are in a magnificent position, have pretty much everyone fit and demonstrated their range of attacking options by replacing Mane and Luis Diaz with Roberto Firmino and Diogo Jota late on.  They will feel they have the momentum and threat to win all four trophies they are challenging for - and if this defeat can act as a dent in City's own forward movement and confidence then so much the better for the Reds. Guardiola's team-sheet will certainly have been welcomed in Liverpool's dressing room before kick-off. Kevin de Bruyne was only fit for the bench and never risked after being injured in the Champions League quarter-final battle against Atletico Madrid.   Kyle Walker was another victim of expensive progress in Spain while key central defenders Aymeric Laporte and Ruben Dias also got no further than the odd warm-up. Fernandinho, 37 shortly, and leaving at the end of the season, was thrust into a thankless task in midfield.  Riyad Mahrez was only a late substitute but the most significant choice was Guardiola's loyalty to Steffen as his goalkeeper for this competition, chosen ahead of Ederson and paying the price for that poor impression of the Brazilian.  Any defeat, especially to Liverpool, hurts perfectionists and winners like Guardiola but, from City's perspective, they will not see this as having a huge impact on their title and Champions League tilt.  Guardiola's selection came after a bruising Champions League test. They will point out Klopp had the option to rest several players against the less physically intimidating and dangerous Benfica with a healthy first-leg lead.  It will not provide consolation in defeat, but Guardiola will feel his choice was made with eyes on the bigger picture and bigger prizes.  Liverpool edged this one and have the psychological ascendancy for a few days at least.  The scenery now shifts to the Premier League and Champions League - and those small margins again.

"Wimbledon: Ons Jabeur on family unable to be at final, childhood dreams & watching Roger Federer's win","Fri, 08 Jul 2022 17:55:30 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/62085208,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/62085208?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"In her latest BBC Sport column, Wimbledon finalist Ons Jabeur talks about her parents not being able to travel to London for Saturday's match.","Wimbledon 2022 on the BBC Venue: All England Club Dates: 27 June-10 July Coverage: Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. I'm not going to lie to you, winning Wimbledon was not my childhood dream.  The childhood dream was always the French Open. We don't have any grass courts in Tunisia so I couldn't imagine being at Wimbledon when I was young. But it became a dream when I reached the quarter-finals last year because I enjoyed being here and enjoyed everything about Wimbledon.  So from then it was the target for me: to come back and win here. My brother Hatem is planning to come over from Tunisia and will hopefully be there on Saturday, but unfortunately the other members of my family don't have visas. It will be tough for them but they will be cheering for me back home. My parents Samira and Ridha and sister Yasmine can't come to London, but it will be great that Hatem, and possibly my brother-in-law, will be here. Now I hope it can be a great, great Saturday. Third seed Jabeur became the first Arab player to reach a Grand Slam singles final with a 6-2 3-6 6-1 win over Tatjana Maria on Thursday If I was able to win the title it would be a double celebration because it is Eid on Saturday, which is one of my favourite holidays. It's like our Christmas. Usually we celebrate by eating barbecued sheep and spending time with the family. I always miss it. But maybe it is going to be a special celebration afterwards and perhaps I will have my own barbecue.  I heard the celebrations back home after my semi-final win were crazy, and they would be even crazier if I win on Saturday. I love to see the joy in Tunisians, even though it is a difficult moment for them. There are tough times, politically, for many people back home. Hopefully, I can win one more match and continue to bring some joy to the people. After every match at Wimbledon there have been some Tunisian fans waiting outside the media balcony, where players do the post-match interviews for television, and they cheer, chant and celebrate. It is an incredible feeling to have them there and bring a Tunisian taste to Wimbledon. People often say I have inspired them because of my achievements as an Arab and African woman. My inspiration is my mum. She is a big fan of tennis and took me to a tennis club when I was only three years old. My mum used to play with her friends and I used to commentate. After the matches I was asked how she could lose! I used to spend the whole day there in the tennis club and I loved it. I had so much fun I even forgot to eat sometimes.  People could tell I had a talent by the way I held the racquet and could keep the ball on the racquet.  Everything was good and that's how I started playing. I grew up playing in a small club in my home town of Monastir and then we moved to Hammam Sousse. There, I played a lot in hotels because there were not a lot of tennis clubs around. After playing local tournaments and getting good results, I played my first international tournament in Paris when I was 10. Then at the age of 13 I went to the capital Tunis to study and train at the same time. It was a sport-specific high school for talented kids and that helped me to train more and develop as a player.  My first big success came when I won the French Open junior title in 2011, but then I struggled a lot with the transition from juniors to the professional tour.  But in recent years I have managed to figure out how to really play with my game and now I am one more match from a senior Grand Slam title. It is an incredible feeling and will be even better if I can win on Saturday. Throughout my career I have watched a lot of matches at Wimbledon, of course. I remember seeing Serena Williams, Venus Williams, Martina Navratilova and Simona Halep winning their titles here, plus when Roger Federer won his record 15th Grand Slam men's title, external against Andy Roddick. It was a match where I was supporting Andy - he was one of my tennis heroes - but I was also very happy for Roger. As I told you in an earlier column, I love everything about Wimbledon - the grass, the strawberries, the traditions. Now I want to be part of this tradition, I want to be a champion and a member at the All England Club. This video can not be played Wimbledon 2022: Best shots of Jabeur as she reaches Wimbledon final in style Of course, my preparations for the final will not alter from the other matches and I will continue to relax between practices. During the tournament I have been often going to the parks - Hyde Park and St James' Park - near my hotel in central London and I will try to do the same today. Before my semi-final win against Tatjana Maria, I think I had some good luck brought to me by a little squirrel who I had a good connection with. I am going to ask him to help me on Saturday! He saw that I had food and he came running to me. I didn't know squirrels could stay and be connected with you - usually they run. He was eating my food. I enjoyed that moment because I love being with the animals and being with nature. I love this positive energy and hopefully that can help me win the Wimbledon title.

Which businesses will close and stay open on day of Queen's funeral?,"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 14:39:21 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62879563,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62879563?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Here's an at-a-glance guide to what will be open and closed on bank holiday Monday.,"Major shops and businesses across the UK shut their doors as a mark of respect for Queen Elizabeth II on the day of her funeral. King Charles III approved a bank holiday on Monday for the state funeral at Westminster Abbey. It was up to employers to decide whether to give staff the day off to observe the national day of mourning.  Many supermarkets and shop chains decided to close their doors, while others limited opening hours. Here's an at-a-glance guide to what was open and closed on the day of the Queen's funeral. It is thought more than a million people travelled to London for the state funeral so some convenience stores stayed open to give them access to food and drink. Department stores Harrods, Selfridges, John Lewis and House of Fraser have shut their doors, while some shopping centres were showing the funeral on big screens. Other shops that closed include: Holiday resort Center Parcs backtracked over a decision to ask guests to leave its sites on the day of the Queen's funeral. Guests have been allowed to stay but on-site facilities including restaurants are shut. Butlin's holiday resort stayed open on Monday, with some changes to arrival times. Some leisure operators decided to close their doors as a mark of respect. Some of the UK's largest pub and restaurant chains stayed open as a place for communities to come together to remember the Queen.  Other aspects of daily life have also been put on hold on the day of the state funeral.  Post offices were closed after Royal Mail announced its services would be suspended. Some of the UK's biggest strikes by postal workers and rail staff have also been put on hold. Major London train stations will be open and hundreds of extra train services have been scheduled with some running through the night. Pharmacies such as Lloyds and Well Pharmacy were shut all day. Some funerals that were scheduled for Monday have been postponed, in some cases at the request of the bereaved families and others because cemeteries and crematoria are closed for the day.  The government advised on its website that the additional bank holiday ""will allow individuals, businesses and other organisations to pay their respects to Her Majesty and commemorate Her reign, while marking the final day of the period of national mourning"". Although it says that some businesses ""may wish to consider closing or postponing events"", there is no statutory entitlement to time off for workers.

The government's national mourning guidance states cancelling or postponing sports fixtures is not obligatory and ""at the discretion of individual organisations"", including on the day of the state funeral. On the day of the funeral, the guidance suggests events could be rescheduled so that they do not clash with the timings of the service and that organisers could hold a period of silence or play the National Anthem at events, with players wearing black armbands. Queen Elizabeth II, the UK's longest-serving monarch, died aged 96, after reigning for 70 years.

Aston Villa 1-1 Burnley: Clarets dig deep to climb out of relegation zone,"Thu, 19 May 2022 22:33:46 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/59618476,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/59618476?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Burnley head into the final day of the season with their Premier League fate in their own hands after securing a hard-earned point at Aston Villa.," From the section Premier Leaguecomments543 Burnley caretaker boss Mike Jackson warned ""it is not mission accomplished"" after the Clarets climbed out of the relegation zone to put their Premier League fate in their own hands. Nick Pope made a string of fine saves to frustrate Aston Villa and help secure a hard-earned point that saw Leeds United drop to 18th before what is certain to be a tense final day on Sunday. Burnley and Leeds are now locked on 35 points, but the Clarets' -18 goal difference is far superior to Leeds' -38. While Jackson's side entertain 12th-placed Newcastle at the weekend, Leeds are at 11th-placed Brentford. ""The least we wanted was a point, we're a little disappointed not to get the three,"" he said after Burnley ended a two-match losing run. ""Everything I've seen tonight is what this group does. They've had to dig in, they've had to work. We'll need it again on Sunday.   ""It's not mission accomplished.""  Ashley Barnes' well-taken penalty put the Clarets in front just before half-time. However, Villa were the better side and the least they deserved was the draw given to them by Emiliano Buendia's equaliser in the 48th minute. Burnley's position would have been even better had Wout Weghorst not somehow failed to convert after being set up by Connor Roberts, whose own effort had been brilliantly saved by Emiliano Martinez. The visitors were the ones defending desperately at the end though after substitute Matt Lowton was sent off in stoppage time - barely five minutes after coming on after catching Calum Chambers with his follow-through as he over-stretched to win the ball. The perceived wisdom is that Burnley have an advantage in the survival battle because they have been down this road so many times before. The reality is they have never gone into the final day with their top-flight future at stake. What they do have is home advantage in addition to their position in the table which, thanks to one strike of the ball, is markedly better than it was at kick-off. Even though Maxwel Cornet was brought down by Buendia for the spot-kick, there was no chance of the Ivorian taking it after his miss at West Ham last month. Barnes kept his nerve despite a slight delay and found the bottom corner as Martinez went the wrong way. There was no doubting goalkeeper Pope was their man of the match, though, as he repelled Villa on at least half a dozen occasions.  The one-handed effort to turn away Bertrand Traore's second-half strike was superb and, as Villa pushed on for the winner, the England keeper twice prevented Danny Ings from putting the home side ahead. While Tyrone Mings' block to turn Weghorst's late shot wide was superb, he shouldn't have been given the opportunity to keep the ball out. If that had gone in, Burnley would only have needed a point on Sunday. As it is, Jackson needs his side to get three to be certain of completing a most unlikely escape act. Although it would take an unlikely sequence of results on the final day, Villa could still secure their first top-10 finish since 2011. However, most attention for them will centre around whether they can shake up the Premier League title battle. As with many teams at this time of the campaign, Villa's issue is maintaining focus. The good news for second-placed Liverpool, given the massive favour they need from Steven Gerrard and his team at leaders Manchester City, is they have not relocated to the beach just yet. They were the better side in the first half, with John McGinn drawing two excellent saves out of Pope. And it was the Scot who delivered the precise pass through the Burnley defence that created Buendia's equaliser. Evidently, the Clarets do not have the luxury of bringing on a substitute in the class of Philippe Coutinho or Ings, as Villa were able to do in the final stages. Like their manager, both players have Liverpool connections. Neither was able to fashion a winner in this game and the red half of Merseyside will hope they were saving their heroics for Sunday at Etihad Stadium. ""We have little time to prepare for the Manchester City game,"" said Gerrard. ""We'll try to make it as difficult as we can for them and we will fight for everything we can. ""We will try to give it our best shot and make our supporters proud on the last day of the season."" Formation  4-3-2-1 Formation  5-3-2 Match ends, Aston Villa 1, Burnley 1.

War in Ukraine: Russia says it may cut gas supplies if oil ban goes ahead,"Tue, 08 Mar 2022 06:26:55 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60656673,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60656673?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,A top official says Russia may close its gas lines to Germany if the West halts oil imports.,"Russia has said it may close its main gas pipeline to Germany if the West goes ahead with a ban on Russian oil. Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said a ""rejection of Russian oil would lead to catastrophic consequences for the global market"", causing prices to more than double to $300 a barrel. The US has been exploring a potential ban with allies as a way of punishing Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. But Germany and the Netherlands rejected the plan on Monday. The EU gets about 40% of its gas and 30% of its oil from Russia, and has no easy substitutes if supplies are disrupted. While the UK would not be directly impacted by supply disruption, as it imports less than 5% of its gas from Russia, it would be affected by prices rising in the global markets as demand in Europe increases. Iain Conn, the former boss of British Gas owner Centrica, said natural gas was ""less freely"" traded compared to oil, and it would be ""much more difficult"" to replace Russian gas if supplies are affected as it is transported through fixed pipelines from country to country. The price of Brent crude - the global benchmark for oil prices - rose to around $130 a barrel on Tuesday following reports that the US and UK will announce its own ban on Russian oil imports. In an address on Russian state television, Mr Novak said it would be ""impossible to quickly find a replacement for Russian oil on the European market"". ""It will take years, and it will still be much more expensive for European consumers. Ultimately, they will be hurt the worst by this outcome,"" he said. Pointing to Germany's decision last month to freeze certification of Nord Stream 2, a new gas pipeline connecting the two countries, he added that an oil embargo could prompt retaliation. ""We have every right to take a matching decision and impose an embargo on gas pumping through the [existing] Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline,"" he said. Russia is the world's second largest gas producer and third largest oil exporter, and any move to impose sanctions on its energy industry would badly damage its own economy. Nathan Piper, head of oil and gas research at Investec, said although imposing sanctions on Russia's oil and gas exports was attractive, ""practically it is challenging"". He said both the global oil and gas markets were tight ahead of the war in Ukraine ""with limited spare capacity to replace any disrupted Russian volumes"". ""The question is now whether US and European leaders are prepared to endure high oil and gas prices to add energy exports to the sanctions list,"" he told the BBC. ""The threat of this action is almost the worst of both worlds, forcing prices up but doing nothing to limit Russian volumes or the revenues flowing to Moscow."" Analysts at Capital Economics have forecast oil prices could rise to $160 a barrel if the West imposed sanctions on Russian exports, but David Oxley, senior global economist at the consultancy, told the BBC it was disruption to Russian gas that would hit countries harder, describing it as a ""completely different kettle of fish"". He said energy intensive industries across Europe could be hit, with ""vast swathes of heavy industry being switched off"" as it is much harder finding replacement gas suppliers compared with oil. EU countries heavily reliant on Russian gas, such as Germany, could switch from gas to coal, he said, but that would run counter to the bloc's climate ambitions and would not be a long-term solution. The energy markets have been supremely volatile over the past week, and understandably so. There are genuine fears that supplies of oil and gas from Russia could be cut off or disrupted.  Yet the response to Russia's suggestion it could close a major pipeline, depriving northern Europe of a large chunk of its gas supplies, has been pretty muted so far.  There are a couple of reasons for this. Firstly, Russia is threatening a tit-for-tat embargo - cutting off its gas exports if the West goes ahead with a ban on Russian oil.  But despite pressure from the US, such a ban is unlikely. European leaders have already poured cold water on the idea - so Russia's counter-threat carries relatively little weight.  And then there's the fact that Russia is still making huge sums from sales of oil and gas to Europe every day, helping to fund its war.   Moscow has everything to gain from exploiting traders' nerves to push up energy prices; but a great deal to lose if it were to carry out its threat. Ukraine has implored the West to adopt an oil and gas ban, but there are concerns it would send prices soaring. Investor fears of an embargo drove Brent crude oil to $139 (Â£106) a barrel at one point on Monday - its highest level for almost 14 years. Meanwhile, wholesale gas prices rose to 565p per therm early on Tuesday, but fell to 480p in the afternoon. UK stock markets rose slightly in early trading after a volatile Monday caused by the US's discussions over a potential Russian oil and gas ban. Early on Tuesday, nickel prices on the London Metal Exchange more than doubled to rise above the $100,000-a-tonne level for the first time, before trading in the metal was suspended. Russia supplies the world with about 10% of its nickel needs, mainly for use in stainless steel and electric vehicle batteries. Quoting unnamed sources, Reuters news agency reported that the US might be willing to move ahead with an embargo without its allies, although it only gets about 3% of its oil from Russia. However, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has dismissed the idea of a wider ban, saying Europe had ""deliberately exempted"" Russian energy from sanctions because its supply could not be secured ""any other way"" at the moment. European powers have, however, committed to move away from Russian hydrocarbons over time, while some Western companies have boycotted Russian shipments or pledged to sell their stakes in Russian energy companies. Mr Novak said that Russian companies were already feeling the pressure of US and European moves to lower the dependence on Russian energy, despite fulfilling all its contractual obligations to deliver oil and gas to Europe. ""We are concerned by the discussion and statements we are seeing regarding a possible embargo on Russian oil and petrochemicals, on phasing them out,"" he said.

Kenyan cyclist Kangangi dies in crash during US race,"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 10:01:02 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/africa/62712921,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/africa/62712921?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Kenyan cyclist Suleiman Kangagi dies following a high-speed crash in a race in the United States on Saturday.,"Suleiman Kangangi had represented Kenya at the Commonwealth Games Kenyan cyclist Suleiman Kangangi has died following a high-speed crash in a race in the United States on Saturday. The 33-year-old, who raced for the East African based Team Amani, was taking part in the Overland gravel race in Vermont - a 59-mile dirt-road contest including almost 7,000ft of climbing. ""Sule is our captain, friend, brother. He is also a father, husband and son,"" the team said in a statement. ""Gaping holes are left when giants fall. Sule was a giant. ""Instead of leading us at the front of the pack, he will now lead us as our guiding pole star as we press forward in the realisation of his dream."" Kangangi finished third in the Tour of Rwanda in 2017 while racing for the German UCI Continental team, Bike Aid, before switching to gravel racing. His latest team, Amani, sets out to ""support the development of young East African cyclists"" primarily from Rwanda, Uganda and Kenya. ""My heartfelt condolences to his family, and the entire cycling community, that has lost a talented cyclist, a mentor and a friend,"" Rachel Ruto, the wife of president-elect William Ruto of Kenya, posted on Twitter. ""We will all miss him as an individual. Kenya has lost a champion. Rest in peace Sule."" About 900 cyclists were competing in the event on Saturday which was won by Amani's John Kariuki while team-mate Jordan Schleck finished third. ""Vermont Overland is completely heartbroken,"" its organiser, Ansel Dickey, said in a statement. ""We extend our deepest sympathies to his family, his friends, Team Amani, and the people of Kenya.""

Kaliningrad row: 'Sanctions have brought my factory to a standstill',"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 17:40:58 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61902322,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61902322?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Sanctions leave Russia's exclave on the EU's borders struggling to trade.,"Igor Pleshkov gives me a tour of his concrete business in Kaliningrad. Not that he's doing much business right now.  Igor's factory has pretty much come to a standstill.  ""We produce commercial concrete, iron concrete and paving stones. We first experienced a shortage of cement back in March, after Europe imposed sanctions on Russian banks.  ""Trains with cement were being turned back at the Lithuanian border, because the rolling stock was owned by leasing companies who were under sanctions.  ""As of June, we haven't produced a single cubic metre."" Kaliningrad is a unique part of Russia. This region is cut off from the rest of the country - the Russian mainland is 300 miles (480km) to the east.  It was the Red Army that seized Kaliningrad (or KÃ¶nigsberg as it was known) from Germany at the end of World War Two. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Kaliningrad suddenly found itself a Russian exclave in the heart of Europe. It's sandwiched between Lithuania and Poland, both members of the European Union and Nato. For supplies Kaliningrad has been heavily reliant on transit routes through Lithuania. But this month Lithuania began implementing EU sanctions on certain Russian goods - including construction materials. It won't allow them to transit through Lithuanian territory to Kaliningrad. This makes Igor's challenge to turn the business around as tough as concrete. ""These sanctions aren't only affecting our business, they affect everyone,"" Igor explains. ""We aren't making anything, so builders can't build anything. There's a chain reaction. We have nothing to pay contractors, taxes or wages.""  The authorities in Kaliningrad say there's nothing to panic about and they plan to bring in more goods by sea. But expect logistical difficulties and higher costs. Back in Moscow, Russian officials are furious. They've been taking aim at Lithuania, the EU, Nato and the West in general.  This week Nikolai Patrushev, head of Russia's powerful Security Council and one of President Vladimir Putin's closest allies, flew to Kaliningrad for meetings. There he warned Russia's response - whatever form it takes - would have ""a serious negative impact"" on the Lithuanian people.  Russia accuses Lithuania of imposing a blockade on Kaliningrad. That's something Lithuanian officials fiercely deny. After all, there is no ban on Russian passengers transiting through Lithuanian territory, or on Russian goods that are not on the EU sanctions list.  On Kaliningrad's Victory Square, most of the people I speak to have only positive things to say about Europe. ""I hope we can reach an agreement with the Lithuanians on transit, because they're not bad people,"" Svetlana tells me.  ""They're not evil! The Poles aren't bad, either. We don't share a border with Russia, but with Poland and Lithuania. They're like family to us. We need to restore relations.""

"Brentford 4-0 Manchester United: 'A joke', 'bullied' & 'rotten' - are Man Utd at rock bottom?","Sat, 13 Aug 2022 21:51:10 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62536761,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62536761?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Manchester United were labelled 'a joke' after being 'bullied' by Brentford in Saturday's 4-0 defeat - but how bad have things become at Old Trafford?," Last updated on 13 August 202213 August 2022.From the section Man Utd If last weekend's defeat at home by Brighton served as a warning for Manchester United and their new manager Erik ten Hag, then Saturday's embarrassing loss at Brentford will have sent alarm bells into overdrive. The Red Devils' first away match of the new campaign ended in a sobering 4-0 reverse, which leaves the Red Devils without a point - and bottom of the league - after two games and desperately searching for answers. BBC Sport expert Chris Sutton believes United may have ""hit rock bottom"", Sky Sports pundit Karen Carney said the situation ""can't get any lower"" for Ten Hag and his players, and Gary Neville said the club's owners are overseeing a ""collective rot"". Former England striker Alan Shearer told BBC Match of the Day: ""It is an absolute mess. Years of failure, years of mismanagement. There is a lack of leadership and the recruitment has been terrible.  ""It will take time and an unbelievable amount of money to get things right, and a lot of patience from the Manchester United fans. They are miles away from where they want to be."" So just how bad is the situation at Old Trafford? BBC Sport takes a closer look. If United's travelling fans were hoping for a fast start from their team in response to last Saturday's loss to Brighton, they were left disappointed. The Red Devils fell behind after just 10 minutes in west London, Josh Dasilva's long-range shot somehow squirming underneath goalkeeper David de Gea, and eight minutes later Mathias Jensen capitalised on De Gea's poor pass to double the Bees' lead with a cool finish. Ben Mee nodded Brentford further in front, before Bryan Mbeumo latched on to a long ball to put the hosts 4-0 up after just 35 minutes. Sky Sports pundit and former captain Neville did not mince his words at full-time, telling viewers: ""We are witnessing the annihilation of Manchester United. ""I thought United would do better but they have been mauled, bullied, messed about with like you wouldn't believe, and there's nowhere to hide. ""I have been watching United for 42 years and I can't think of a moment when I have thought things have been as bad as that in the first half."" This is the first time United have started a league campaign with consecutive losses since the first edition of the Premier League - which, funnily enough, they went on to win. The stats do not make pleasant reading for Ten Hag either, the Dutchman becoming the first manager since John Chapman in 1921 to lose his opening two games in charge of the club. The Red Devils' recent away record is atrocious - this is the first time they have suffered seven straight league defeats on the road since 1936, when they tumbled to 11 consecutive away losses. Remarkably, United have now conceded four goals in a game seven times since the beginning of the 2021-22 season. They have also let in four first-half goals on three occasions since October 2020. To add insult to injury, this is Brentford's biggest top-flight win since they beat Grimsby Town 6-1 in April 1938. Liverpool, who visit Old Trafford a week on Monday, must be licking their lips. Then there are the club's owners. There have been multiple protests against the Glazer family's ownership of the Old Trafford side in recent years - including one in May 2021 which caused the Red Devils' match against Liverpool to be postponed. United fans are planning another protest against the American family, who have owned the club since 2005, during their latest meeting with their bitter rivals. #EmptyOldTrafford has even been trending on Twitter as supporters call for a boycott of the game a week on Monday. ""Joel Glazer has to get on the plane tomorrow,"" Neville said. ""He has to get over to Manchester and he has to start to divert the issues away from the club and tell everybody what his plan is with the football club. ""When a business is failing and not performing, it is the owner of that business' fault. It is failing miserably. ""They took £24m out of the club two months ago, now they have a decrepit, rotting stadium that is second rate, when it was one of the best stadiums 10 to 15 years ago. ""You've got a football project where they haven't got a clue. You can look at the players all you like, but there are big things that need to be put right. ""They have to show up and face the music. The club is rotten."" MUST, the club's Supporters' Trust, issued a statement in the aftermath of Saturday's defeat, saying the result feels like ""the culmination of a long-term direction of travel"". It added: ""What we have witnessed tonight is an embarrassment - no, a humiliation - for Manchester United fans. And yet in many ways it was not a surprise."" A stunned Ten Hag admitted after the full-time whistle that United need quality players - but on this evidence, who would want to join them? United's protracted move for Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong appears to have stalled, with the Dutchman reluctant to leave the Spanish giants because of a contractual disagreement which centres on deferred payments. They have already splashed out over £65m on Tyrell Malacia, Christian Eriksen and Lisandro Martinez this summer, which takes the club's spending since their last trophy - the 2017 Europa League - to about £672m. United ended their recent interest in Bologna striker Marko Arnautovic because of a combination of the Italian club's transfer fee demands and the negative reaction from Red Devils fans. However, negotiations are reported to be at an advanced stage with Juventus midfielder Adrien Rabiot. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live's #EuroLeagues podcast, French journalist Julien Laurens said: ""They are not helping themselves. ""The non-existence of a transfer strategy, not just now but since Fergie [Sir Alex Ferguson] left, is not just baffling, it's outrageous."" Former United midfielder Robbie Savage, speaking on 5 Live, added: ""How many more times will these players cost Manchester United managers their jobs? ""The recruitment has not been good enough over the last 10 years. Look at the centre forwards they have signed - [Edinson] Cavani, [Zlatan] Ibrahimovic, Falcao, [Odion] Ighalo. Now they're linked with Arnautovic. Where is the recruitment process?"" Dean: It's fitting we chose a bright green kit as that's the face of every Man United fan watching. Sick to our stomachs. Andrew: If *Brighton* and *Brentford* are able to take Manchester United to the cleaners... what will the likes of Arsenal, Liverpool, and Manchester City do to this team? Utterly clueless. United are going to be relegation candidates & Erik ten Hag will be out by Christmas. Zahi: I reckon most of these Man United players will have plenty of time for Xmas shopping when the season breaks. No way any of them will be in Qatar. Baron: Frenkie de Jong's chance of signing for United just went from 0% to 0%. Barotta: Man U will get their first points before the World Cup break for sure. Alex: It's great to see the Man Utd fans crying. Very loud when they are winning but when the club goes through a bad patch they soon turn. Real fans?? Glory hunters!

Train strikes: Series of walkouts from Saturday suspended,"Fri, 04 Nov 2022 21:42:56 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-63510380,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-63510380?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Walkouts on 5, 7, and 9 November are cancelled - but it is too late to stop disruption to services.","Passengers are being warned of extensive disruption to train services on Saturday despite a series of strikes by railway workers being called off. Network Rail warned that services would remain ""extremely limited"", with trains on Monday also likely to be affected. The RMT union said it would now enter ""a period of intensive negotiations"" with Network Rail and train operators. The strikes, planned for 5, 7 and 9 November, had been called in a dispute over pay and conditions. They involved staff at Network Rail, which employs signalling workers across England, Scotland and Wales, as well as workers at 14 train companies. Rail companies say the RMT announcement came too late to prevent disruption and a temporary revised timetable for Saturday, Sunday and Monday will remain in place. There is expected to be a major impact across the network, with only a fifth of services due to run between 07:30 and 18:30 GMT on Saturday. However, the suspension is a significant development, as it is the first time in the RMT's long-running dispute that a strike has been called off to make further talks easier. Another transport union, the TSSA, had already called off November action at Network Rail so that discussions could continue, and on Friday suspended planned rail strikes on Saturday, Monday and Wednesday at different firms. It had planned to take strike action at five train firms including Avanti West Coast and West Midlands Trains. Avanti said on Friday it would not reinstate services on Saturday, Monday and Wednesday. West Midlands Trains said a reduced timetable will remain in place for at least Saturday and Monday. The cancellation of the strikes has come ""too late"" for thousands of rugby fans travelling to Cardiff for the Wales v New Zealand autumn international, Network Rail Wales said. There will be fewer trains before the game, and none leaving Cardiff after it has finished. Tom and Lydia Ellis, who are from New Zealand but living in Bristol, will have to take a bus to get to the game. ""I won't be fully relaxed until we're in the stadium,"" said Mr Ellis. ScotRail will only run a skeleton service on Saturday, with the rail operator warning of significant disruption to its services. Only 11 of its routes will remain open. And a London Underground strike planned for Thursday is still set to go ahead. RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said the threat of strike action ""has made the rail employers see sense"". ""We have always wanted to secure a negotiated settlement and that is what we will continue to push for in this next phase of intensive talks. ""Our priority is our members, and we are working towards securing a deal on job security, a decent pay rise and good working conditions."" He added that there had been ""the promise of an offer"" on pay from the rail operating companies. However, when contacted by the BBC, rail employers and the government said their position had not changed. The suspension has been announced 11 days before a fresh RMT strike ballot is due to close on 15 November.   Mr Lynch previously told the BBC that he expected workers to vote in favour, and warned that there could be strikes for another six months if no agreement is reached. Tim Shoveller, Network Rail's chief negotiator, said the company is looking forward to ""getting back round the table with all our trades unions early next week to see if the progress made this week can be built on, and a resolution found"". Network Rail continues to advise passengers to check before they travel, and to only travel by rail if absolutely necessary on Saturday and Monday.  Mr Shoveller said on Monday there will be ""limited ability"" to change the strike timetable.  Transport Secretary Mark Harper said suspending the strike action was ""a positive development for passengers up and down the country"". He added that calling off the latest ones has given negotiations between unions and employers a ""better chance of success"". Rail Minister Huw Merriman said he did not want to ""rule anything in or out"" when asked if the government would put more money on the table to help resolve the dispute.  The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents train companies, said that it was ""positive"" that the RMT had ""stepped back from the brink"". Speaking on Thursday, chairman Steve Montgomery said the RDG was ""working up to"" making an offer once it had made an agreement with unions on workplace reforms.  He said there were some areas in which there could be ""commonality"" between the two parties on workforce reform.  Rosters for drivers are typically agreed a week in advance, and so the ""short notice cancellation"" of the strikes ""means that train driver availability will inevitably be very challenging and rely primarily on volunteers"", the RDG added.

The Senegalese pop star who dared to sing about rape,"Sun, 29 May 2022 23:14:05 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-61023659,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-61023659?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"After rape in Senegal was finally made a serious crime, a pop star dared to tell her own story.","Following widespread protests in Senegal about the rape and murder of women, the law was changed in 2020 to make rape a serious crime instead of a misdemeanour. The events opened up a conversation around sexual assault, shame and accountability, headed by a pop star who dared to sing about her own experience. In her home, two hours south of Senegal's capital, Dakar, pop star Lady Mounass sings me a song in her native Wolof language:  I don't have the strength to fight Not even the strength to argue I lost my confidence You betrayed me You took what was dearest to me Please please, consideration for women Lady Mounass is known for her saucy lyrics and signature sexy style, but this song is very different. It details the emotional trauma she suffered after being raped by two men in 2011. ""It's very difficult for me to sing this song unaccompanied because the words are a description of what actually happened to me,"" she says. ""I cry myself to sleep frequently. Every day, I'm living with the shame attached to it."" Lady Mounass says she went to the police and one of her attackers was arrested, but later released without charge. Her family wanted her to keep quiet about her experience, but during an interview on Senegalese television last year, she inadvertently revealed the truth. ""The presenter kept asking me, 'You seem to have a particular interest in this issue, you seem to be particularly sensitive to this topic.' And so the tears began welling up and I just couldn't contain it."" The revelation sent shock waves through her life. Some critics suggested her ""provocative"" style had given men the ""wrong impression"", while others claimed she'd made the whole thing up as a publicity stunt. ""Some people tried to say that I was only doing it to get attention - and that really hurt my feelings,"" says Lady Mounass. ""My own family said, 'This is exactly why we told you not to talk about this publicly.'"" In the weeks that followed, many people contacted Lady Mounass to talk about their own experiences of sexual assault. There were harrowing stories - one woman told her she had been raped by her grandfather; another by her father, and that her mother had refused to believe her. As the stories came in, Lady Mounass ended up becoming a spokeswoman against sexual violence. She joined a government campaign, touring the country to raise awareness of sexual violence and the legal support available to women. Her song became the soundtrack to that campaign. Women have traditionally been heavily stigmatised and reluctant to speak out about rape in Senegal, let alone brave enough to release a song about it. Lady Mounass has decided the shame isn't hers to carry.   But for some women, becoming a victim of sexual violence means rejection by their family and community. This is what happened to two young women I met at the first Senegalese-run refuge for victims of domestic and sexual violence. We have changed their names.  Located in a quiet Dakar suburb, the refuge is run by Yacine Diouf, the daughter of a former president. We enter through a heavy wooden door, ""to keep out angry husbands and families"", says Diouf. The refuge is able to provide a home for 25 to 30 women at a time, as well as their children. They will be offered training and skills to help them live independently once they leave. Deena is 19, but looks a lot younger. Dressed in a white T-shirt and jeans, she scrolls endlessly on her phone. Deena was raped when she was 15. The rape resulted in a pregnancy and now she is the mother of a three-year-old child. ""The man who attacked me was detained by the police,"" she says. ""He gave false testimony. They let him go after a month. Even so, he recognised the child and accepted paternity. I used that to file a complaint, but he ran off to Guinea."" Deena struggles to get by on $2 a day. ""Life is hard. I was at school but I've had to give it up. I have no choice, I have to provide for my child. It's a difficult situation, my parents got divorced after what happened."" Sitting next to Deena is Sarah, also 19. Last year Sarah was raped and now she is pregnant. She didn't go to the police or tell anyone about what happened. The rape was only discovered when her pregnancy started to show - then her family kicked her out. She was brought to the refuge when she was found sleeping on the streets by staff. ""In her culture, there's a lot of shame attached to being raped, so both her maternal and paternal family rejected her,"" explains a refuge worker who is looking after Sarah. In Senegal, the concept of ""sutura"" - discretion - can pressure victims of sexual violence to stay silent, says Fatou Warkha, who runs a YouTube channel promoting women's rights.  ""Sutura means that women feel they have to hide these things, so this has been a real obstacle in changing the way that women raise the issue of rape when it happens,"" she says.  Warkha is part of a group of feminists who created the Dafadoy Collective, which means ""enough is enough"". In 2019, campaigners began using the #Dafadoy hashtag, much like the #metoo movement, and organised sit-ins to protest against sexual violence.  That year, a series of sexual attacks on women led to widespread protests. Most prominent was the case of Bineta Camara, 23, who was strangled after her murderer tried to rape her. Her case caused anger, not just among feminists, but across a large cross-section of society. El Hadji Elias Ndoye, a young graduate, was one of the 3,000 people who joined the protests in Place de la Nation in Dakar. ""Due to the patriarchal nature of the society here, men's presence in these demonstrations is essential,"" says Ndoye. ""Some people accuse me of being under a woman's thumb, but truthfully, it's time for women's voices to be heard. The silent majority of men are with us because it's their daughters, their sisters, their family members who are vulnerable."" Also protesting was Mamadou Maktar Gaye, the head of Jamra - one of the most influential Islamic organisations in the country. He and Jamra stood alongside their ""sisters"" in opposition to what Gaye refers to as ""the scourge of rape"". ""It's about men having to change their behaviour,"" he says.  The protests forced a change in the law that activists like Warkha had long been campaigning for.  After a unanimous vote in parliament, President Macky Sall officially made rape a crime on 10 January 2020. Rape cases are now heard in criminal court with a sentence of 10 years to life, when previously they would have been tried in a magistrates court with a maximum sentence of 10 years. Rape first became punishable by law in Senegal in 1999, when it was classed as a misdemeanour. Two decades later, in 2019, there were 1,026 official reports of sexual violence, of which half were believed to involve rape. But accurate numbers are hard to come by.  A representative from the Ministry of Women, Family and Vulnerable People told the BBC they did not have figures relating to how many women were really affected - and that in any case, reported statistics on rape notoriously underestimate the scale of the problem. Steps are now being taken to make women feel more comfortable when reporting sexual assault to the police. Police stations are being redesigned so that women are met at reception and taken to a separate room, where they can speak to a female officer.  These changes are part of a project funded by the EU and led by a senior police officer, Commissaire Binetou Guisse, whose job it is to monitor gender-related violence around the country. The police also work closely with women from the local community who act as important intermediaries. They are known as ""badianu goch"" - a term meaning paternal aunt, an important figure in Senegalese families. The government now trains badianu goch to help protect vulnerable women and children. ""These women are the ones who tend to know what's going on and they will bring the issue to the attention of the police,"" says Guisse.  Guisse says the changes seem to be having a positive effect, with more people coming forward to report domestic and sexual violence.  Free legal advice is also being provided in clinics around the country by the Association of Senegalese Jurists (AJS), who have been on the front line of women's rights in Senegal for decades. They say they recorded more than 3,000 cases of sexual violence in 2021 alone, but point out that they don't have clinics in the majority of the country's 42 departments. And staff at one AJS bureau told us that because the new law is more complex, it's resulting in a longer legal process.  ""There are many men currently being prosecuted but so far, not a single man has been convicted - partly because the new procedure is a lengthy one and requires an extensive investigation,"" says Aby Diallo, AJS president and a former senior police officer.   So could this longer legal process actually be counter-productive?  Diallo doesn't think so. ""It's a good law, but it needs better application, it needs more magistrates and it needs more awareness in the local community about how the new law operates."" She explains that under the old law, many rapists were coming out of prison after just a few months, and this was having a hugely detrimental impact on the victims. ""Ultimately, it is tough sentences which are likely to drive home the severity of these actions,"" says Diallo.  But with a single conviction yet to be made, it's clear that many victims of sexual violence are still waiting for justice. Lady Mounass hopes the song she has written about her ordeal will help other women to speak out. ""I have a platform as a singer and I feel a sense of responsibility. I felt that I had to say something about this,"" she says. ""I'm calling on men in particular to stop the culture around rape and to stop making it something that women feel they have to keep quiet about.""

COP27: What is the Egypt climate conference and why is it important?,"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 23:43:07 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-63316362,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-63316362?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,This year's climate summit comes amid spiralling energy costs and diplomatic tensions.,"World leaders are discussing action to tackle climate change at the COP27 climate summit in Egypt. It follows a year of climate-related disasters and broken temperature records. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is attending, having previously said he would not.  United Nations (UN) climate summits are held every year, for governments to agree steps to limit global temperature rises.  They are referred to as COPs, which stands for ""Conference of the Parties"". The parties are the attending countries that signed up to the original UN climate agreement in 1992.  COP27 is the 27th annual UN meeting on climate. It is taking place in Sharm el-Sheikh until 18 November. The world is warming because of emissions produced by humans, mostly from burning fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal. Global temperatures have risen 1.1C and are heading towards 1.5C, according to the UN's climate scientists, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). If temperatures rise 1.7 to 1.8C above 1850s levels, the IPCC estimates that half the word's population could be exposed to life-threatening heat and humidity. To prevent this, 194 countries signed the Paris Agreement in 2015, pledging to ""pursue efforts"" to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C. More than 200 governments have been invited.  In a speech on Monday Mr Sunak is set to urge world leaders at COP27 to move ""further and faster"" in transitioning to renewable energy. He will say Russia's invasion of Ukraine ""reinforced"" the importance of ending dependence on fossil fuels. Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson is also going, but King Charles will not be there, following government advice. However, he held a pre-conference reception at Buckingham Palace.  Vladimir Putin is not due to go, although Russian delegates are still expected to take part.  Other countries, including China, have not confirmed whether their leaders will attend. Hosts Egypt called on countries to put their differences aside and ""show leadership"" on the issue of climate change.  Environmental charities, community groups, think tanks, businesses and faith groups will also take part. The conference is taking place in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. This will be the fifth time a COP has been hosted in Africa.  The region's governments hope it will draw attention to the severe impacts of climate change on the continent. The IPCC says Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions in the world.  Currently, 20 million people are estimated to be facing food insecurity in east Africa because of drought.  However, choosing Egypt as the venue has attracted controversy. Some human rights and climate campaigners say the government has stopped them attending because they have criticised its rights record. Ahead of the meeting, countries were asked to submit ambitious national climate plans. Only 25 have done so to date. COP27 will focus on three main areas: Some areas not fully resolved or covered at COP26 will be picked up: There will also be themed days on issues including gender, agriculture and biodiversity. Finance has been long been an issue at climate talks. In 2009, developed countries committed to give $100bn (Â£88bn) a year, by 2020, to developing countries to help them reduce emissions and prepare for climate change.  The target was missed and moved back to 2023.  But developing nations are also calling for payments for ""loss and damage"" - the impacts faced now.  An option for making such payments was excluded from the Bonn climate talks, after pushback from wealthier nations who feared they would be forced to pay compensation for decades. But the EU agreed that discussions should take place at COP27. It depends who you ask. Following intense negotiations, the issue of loss and damage payments is on the official agenda of COP27. Developing countries will also be pushing to have a date set for when they might start to receive payments.  Developed nations will be looking for more commitment from large developing countries - such as China, India, Brazil, Indonesia and South Africa - to move away from coal, the dirtiest of the fossil fuels.  There are also pledges from last year's meeting - on forests, coal, and methane - that more countries may support. However, some scientists believe world leaders have left it too late and no matter what is agreed at COP27, 1.5C will not be achieved. Climate activist Greta Thunberg is among the list of those who will not attend. She recently described the global summit as a forum for ""greenwashing"", saying the COP conferences ""encourage gradual progress"". Earlier in October she told the BBC's media editor Amol Rajan in an interview: ""I'm not needed there... there will be other people who will attend, from the most affected areas. And I think that their voice there is more important."" Top image from Reuters. Climate stripes visualisation courtesy of Prof Ed Hawkins and University of Reading. Why is the world getting warmer?

EU leaders to back Ukraine as candidate at Brussels summit,"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 23:01:11 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61891467,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61891467?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"An EU summit will give the green light but Kyiv admits ""real integration"" will start after the war.","Ukraine and Moldova have both been granted EU candidate status, President of the European Council Charles Michel has announced. ""Today marks a crucial step on your path towards the EU,"" Mr Michel said, describing the European Council's decision as a ""historic moment"".  Ukraine applied days after the Russian invasion in February, and the process moved at a record speed. Its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, hailed Thursday's decision. ""It's a unique and historical moment in UA[Ukraine]-EU relations..."" he tweeted. ""Ukraine's future is within the EU.""  The mayor of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, former boxer Vitali Klitschko, paid an emotional tribute to his fellow citizens resisting the invasion. ""We paid a very high price for this chance,"" he wrote on Telegram. ""Yes, we still have a lot to do on the way to the European family.  ""But I am sure that Ukraine will do everything necessary, fulfil all the conditions and pass the necessary laws. Because otherwise our state has no future. Indeed, our best defenders are dying for it."" Candidate status is the first official step towards EU membership. But it can take many years to join and there's no guarantee of success. The European Commission president said the accession process would be ""merit-based"" and ""by the book"", and that formal negotiations would not begin until conditional reforms are carried out. These include bolstering the rule of law, and fighting corruption. The Commission is due to take stock at the end of 2022. The step is undoubtedly a big moment for Ukraine, and a popular one.  While Moldova's application was accepted, a third former Soviet state, Georgia, has still to qualify for candidacy. Mr Michel said that the Council recognised the country's ""European perspective"" and was ""ready to grant candidate status once the outstanding priorities are addressed"". Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili tweeted that her country was ""ready to work with determination over the next months to reach the candidate status"". European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said all three countries were ""part of our European family"". ""This decision strengthens us all,"" she tweeted. ""It strengthens Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia, in the face of Russian imperialism. And it strengthens the EU. Because it shows once again to the world that we are united and strong in the face of external threats."" President Zelensky spoke of his country's desire for candidate status in almost every speech over the past week. He knows that starting down the path of EU membership will permanently shift Ukraine out of Russia's sphere of influence. Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda told reporters the EU's political backing was very important for Ukrainians: ""This is the least we can provide for them."" Outside the summit building, activist Anna Melenchuk from Kyiv told the BBC: ""People I know are dying every day at the hands of Russian soldiers. This is why it's so important to have the European Union's support."" It was pro-EU protests that ousted Ukraine's Russia-backed President Viktor Yanukovych in February 2014.  That event in turn led to the annexation of Crimea and the separatist uprisings, the events that Ukrainians see as the start of the current war. The Kremlin knew this was on the cards and has already been acting as if it's no big deal. Last week in St Petersburg, President Vladimir Putin claimed he had ""nothing against"" Ukraine's possible membership of the European Union: ""It's their sovereign decision to join economic unions or not.""  He said it, but did he mean it? It is hard to believe Russia's president would sit back and watch the country he invaded join the European Union.  President Putin once described Russians and Ukrainians as ""one people, a single whole"" and views Ukraine as a territory that, historically, belongs to Russia. The Russian invasion is widely seen as his attempt to force Ukraine back into Moscow's orbit, and he shows no sign of ending the offensive. EU candidate status for Ukraine sends a strong message to Moscow: that neither Kyiv nor Brussels accepts the Putin vision of a new European order.  But he will be aware that the road from candidate status to EU member is a long one. Along the way Ukraine will face plenty of hurdles - quite likely many put there by Russia.  The long process of joining the EU frustrated Western Balkan leaders at a separate Brussels summit on Thursday. Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama warned Kyiv to be under no illusions: ""North Macedonia is a candidate [for] 17 years if I have not lost count, Albania eight, so welcome to Ukraine."" North Macedonian Prime Minister Dimitar Kovacevski expressed his ""dissatisfaction"" at the lack of progress in their own bids to join the EU.  Bulgaria is effectively blocking North Macedonia and Albania's membership bids while other countries have yet to make the necessary reforms.  Some EU diplomats have previously voiced concerns that giving Ukraine candidate status could offer false hope.  French President Emmanuel Macron said in May that the prospect of membership was decades away and the Nato secretary general has warned the conflict could last years.  ""We do not accept the idea of the queue,"" Ukraine's EU envoy told the BBC, pointing to work carried out since the EU and Ukraine signed an association agreement in 2014.  As well as deciding on candidate status, EU leaders were also due to discuss food security in light of Russia's blockade of Ukrainian ports, condemned by the EU's foreign policy chief this week as a war crime.  They were also considering President Macron's proposal for a wider ""European Political Community"", to include countries waiting to join the EU or even those that have left, which would currently include the UK.  Although a number of EU diplomats have rejected the idea as half-baked, the Ukrainian ambassador did not dismiss the idea out of hand. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said her preference would be to build on existing structures such as the G7 and Nato. Additional reporting by Patrick Jackson, BBC News.

Russia dredges up landing ship hit by Ukraine missile fire,"Sat, 02 Jul 2022 18:51:36 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-62022476,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-62022476?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The Russian troop ship Saratov sank in a Black Sea port after a Ukrainian missile strike.,"Russia says it has salvaged a large landing ship scuttled by its crew after a Ukrainian missile strike damaged it in the port of Berdyansk on 24 March. A Telegram post by a Russian-appointed official in southern Ukraine, Vladimir Rogov, says Tochka-U ballistic missiles had targeted the Russian-held port. The crew sank the ship ""to prevent detonation of the on-board munitions by the fire that had started"", he said. At the time Ukraine said it had hit the ship. Only now has Russia confirmed it. Russian reports do not give details of the ship's damage, but say it will be towed to Kerch in Crimea. The Black Sea peninsula was annexed by Russia in 2014. The Ukrainian military's report on the missile strike on 24 March named the landing ship as the Orsk - but the ship salvaged by Russia is the Saratov. The Orsk is another of the six large landing ships in Russia's Black Sea Fleet.  The fleet's website kchf.ru confirms that the Saratov was damaged and sank in port on 24 March - but does not mention the Ukrainian missile attack. The ship ""was damaged by fire and the explosions triggered by it"", it says - contradicting the version given by Mr Rogov. ""With damage to its hull the ship sank at its berth,"" the fleet website says. This video can not be played Watch: Footage shows Russian ship destroyed, Ukraine says The 58-year-old Saratov joined the Soviet navy in 1964. It can carry up to 20 tanks, or 45 armoured personnel carriers or 50 trucks, as well as up to 400 marines. The ship is 113m (371ft) long and can carry a load of up to 1,500 tonnes. Berdyansk lies on the Sea of Azov, between the port city of Mariupol and Crimea. Capturing Mariupol, now in ruins after months of bombardment, was a key strategic goal for the Russian military. The Ukrainian military takes more pride in having knocked out the Black Sea Fleet flagship - the missile cruiser Moskva - in April. Two Neptune missiles were credited with having sunk it, though Russia disputes that, saying the ship sank after a big fire on board.

England v India: Tourists win by 49 runs at Edgbaston to clinch series win,"Sat, 09 Jul 2022 18:13:23 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/62107731,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/62107731?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,England are thrashed by 49 runs in the second Twenty20 at Edgbaston as India clinch the three-match series with a game to spare.," Last updated on 9 July 20229 July 2022.From the section Cricketcomments1020 England were thrashed by 49 runs in the second Twenty20 at Edgbaston as India clinched the three-match series with a game to spare. Chasing 171 to level the series, England put in another disappointing batting performance and were bowled out for 121 in 17 overs. Jason Roy was caught at slip off the first ball of England's pursuit and captain Jos Buttler followed in the third over, caught behind on review for four - Bhuvneshwar Kumar the bowler on both occasions. Bhuvneshwar claimed 3-15 and Jasprit Bumrah and Yuzvendra Chahal took two wickets apiece in another exciting India performance. Moeen Ali top-scored for England with 35, while David Willey's 33 not out prevented an even heavier defeat in Buttler's second match as captain. England's bowlers had earlier fought back well to restrict India to 170-8. Seamer Richard Gleeson, making his England debut at the age of 34, took 3-15, including the big scalps of India captain Rohit Sharma for 31, superstar Virat Kohli for one and the dangerous Rishabh Pant for 26. Chris Jordan took 4-27 but Ravindra Jadeja's 46 not out from 29 balls proved crucial in lifting India to a challenging total, albeit one that still looked gettable. India now hold an unassailable 2-0 lead before the series finale on Sunday at Trent Bridge. A three-match one-day international series follows next week. England have set the benchmark in white-ball cricket for the past five years under Eoin Morgan but, with Morgan now retired, they have been comprehensively outplayed for the second game in succession. As in the 50-run loss in Southampton, the batting, usually England's strength in this format, cost them after the bowlers put in a decent display. Roy again had no answer to Bhuvneshwar's imperious control of the new ball and, after a review showed Buttler had got a toe-end on an attempted cut, the hosts never looked like recovering.  There was a chaotic run-out for Chris Jordan and the way last man Matt Parkinson had his stumps splattered by a Harshal Patel yorker almost emphasised the gulf between the sides. England are missing regulars for various reasons but Buttler and Matthew Mott - their new white-ball coach who was appointed in May - have work to do if they are going to compete at the T20 World Cup in October. India, who were able to recall Kohli, Pant, Bumrah and Ravindra Jadeja after they sat out the first match, look the more likely winners right now. The batting took the shine off a feel-good story. Gleeson was England's oldest debutant for 15 years and did not play professional cricket until the age of 27, previously working as a community coach and playing minor county cricket. On his first England appearance, less than year after considering retirement because of back injuries, he removed three of the biggest names in the game. After India raced to 49-0 in the fifth over, the Lancashire quick had Rohit caught off a top-edge with his fifth ball. His next over was a stunning double-wicket maiden. Kohli sliced a high catch to backward point off the first ball and Pant was caught behind off a thin edge next up, but Hardik Pandya kept the hat-trick ball out. Gleeson bowled 16 dot balls in his four overs - his figures the second best by an England debutant in T20s. He relentlessly bowled a good length with impressive speed, reaching 90mph. ""If you said when I was 27 and starting out in pro cricket that I'd be playing at 34 for England I never would have imagined it,"" Gleeson told BBC Sport. ""It goes to show if you keep persevering, if you've got something, keep believing in yourself, you never know what can happen."" Jordan followed his impressive showing on Thursday with another strong performance. He also took two in two - Suryakumar Yadav holing out to deep mid-wicket for 15 and Hardik cutting straight to backward point on 12. Even in a losing cause, Jordan looks to have reaffirmed his position as a crucial member of this attack. Gleeson will surely have earned more opportunities. England bowler Richard Gleeson, speaking to BBC Sport: ""They were a great crowd - apart from at the start, when they were singing, 'Who are you, who are you?' ""But when I got a couple of wickets, and their tail was up, there was a round of applause every time I went down to fine leg. A great atmosphere."" India bowler Bhuvneshwar Kumar, speaking to Sky Sports: ""When the ball swings you always enjoy yourself. ""In previous years in England I don't remember much help with the white ball but this time there is swing and bounce."" England captain Jos Buttler, speaking to Sky Sports: ""Very disappointing, we didn't play anywhere near well enough to win the game so we got what we deserved. ""It was a fantastic debut by Richard Gleeson - not just the wickets, but the guys he got out as well are fantastic players."" These comments are now closed.

UK elections 2022: A really simple guide,"Thu, 05 May 2022 21:01:20 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-60304595,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-60304595?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Local elections in England, Wales and Scotland, and a general election in Northern Ireland, took place on 5 May.","Elections have taken place across the UK on 5 May. Voters in England, Wales, and Scotland were picking who should run services that affect everyday life in their local area. People in Northern Ireland were choosing its government. The results are likely to reflect how people feel about Boris Johnson, the ""partygate"" scandal, how Covid has been handled and the rising cost of living.

 Enter your postcode, or the name of your English, Scottish or Welsh council area or Northern Ireland constituency to find out.    Local councils are responsible for everything from bins, bus routes and potholes, to providing mental health services, deciding planning applications and managing schemes to tackle climate change. In England, more than 4,000 councillors in 146 councils are up for election in major cities including Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham and all 32 London boroughs.  South Yorkshire was voting for a regional mayor and 1,000 parish councils were electing about 10,000 councillors. Because of the huge number of seats being contested across England - some of them for the first time since 2018 - the results are likely to paint the clearest picture of the national mood.  The election for Northern Ireland's government is largely a contest between the parties in two blocs - unionists, who favour remaining part of the United Kingdom, and nationalists, who favour a united Ireland.  Since 2003, the Democratic Unionist Party has been the largest party in the national assembly, followed by nationalists Sinn FÃ©in.  The two parties, along with other unionist and nationalist parties, and an increasingly popular third bloc of non-aligned parties, have governed under a mandatory power-sharing agreement that ended decades of fighting.  Recent polls suggest Sinn FÃ©in could take the lead for the first time. If Sinn FÃ©in becomes the largest party, the DUP has not said whether it would agree to share power. That means it's possible that even after the election, the Assembly could remain without a devolved government for at least six months. All seats in 22 local councils are being contested across Wales, where people can vote from the age of 16.  The political make-up has been mixed since the last election in 2017 and the majority of councils are currently run by coalitions - an agreement between at least two parties to share power. Eyes will be on whether Labour can maintain its hold over Cardiff and the cities along the M4 corridor, and how the Conservatives perform in the north-east of the country, where they made gains last time. There was voting in all 32 local authorities. The last election in 2017 saw the Conservatives make big gains from Labour, however they failed to gain overall control and most councils have been run by coalitions ever since.  The largest cities - Glasgow and Edinburgh - are always ones to watch, but this year's results are also likely to reflect how Scots feel more generally about such issues as recent council tax changes and post-pandemic recovery.

Salman Rushdie: Did a ‘chance’ airport meeting lead to fatwa?,"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 23:32:48 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-62561895,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-62561895?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Two British imams met an Iranian minister hours before the decree calling for the author’s death, was issued in 1989.","Sir Salman Rushdie remains in hospital in the US, a fortnight after suffering ""life-changing"" injuries in a stabbing in New York state.  The Satanic Verses author has faced death threats for more than 30 years, ever since Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa - a formal proclamation by an Islamic legal scholar - calling for him to be killed.  Before the February 1989 decree, publicly at least, Iran had largely ignored the controversial book - but then, just hours before the fatwa was issued, a meeting took place at Tehran's main airport between two British imams and an Iranian government minister.  Bad weather closed in on the Iranian capital as Kalim Siddiqui and Ghayasuddin Siddiqui arrived at Mehrabad Airport. Both men had been attending a conference in Tehran to mark a decade since the country's Islamic Revolution. They were now trying to get home to the UK.  Inside the airport, they bumped into an Iranian government minister - Mohammad Khatami - who asked to have a private word with Kalim.  ""They went to a corner and chatted,"" Ghayasuddin would later explain in the BBC's 2009 documentary, The Satanic Verses Affair. When Kalim returned, he explained what they had spoken about. ""He was asking my view about Salman Rushdie - and I told him, 'You know, something drastic has to happen,'"" recounted Ghayasuddin.  Kalim told his travelling companion that the minister had been on his way to see Iran's then-Supreme Leader and top Shia Muslim religious authority, Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. A few hours later, the ayatollah issued the fatwa.  Not only was it made against the Satanic Verses' author, but also its publishers, editors and translators. ""I call on all valiant Muslims wherever they may be in the world to kill them without delay, so that no one will dare insult the sacred beliefs of Muslims henceforth,"" it read.  Sir Salman - who was knighted in 2007 - had published his controversial fourth novel in late 1988. The book's title refers to a disputed historical account in Islamic theology. The Prophet Muhammad is said to have been dictating two verses of the Koran, later abandoned because they were the result of deception by the devil.  Many Muslims argued Sir Salman's novel referenced Islamic theology and was a grave insult to their faith. They also objected, among other things, to characters depicting prostitutes being given the same names as wives of the Prophet. For more than six months up until the fatwa, there had been protests across the world. The book had been banned in several countries including India - and demonstrations in Pakistan had left several people dead. In the UK, copies were burned in Bolton and Bradford.  But, until then, there had not been a huge public outcry from Iran's leaders. Had this airport meeting, later claimed by both Siddiquis to have been a chance encounter, secured the fatwa? Kalim and Ghayasuddin were not related, they just happened to have the same last name. Like Sir Salman, both were born in British-ruled India - before the 1947 Partition - and had settled in the UK. For several years in the late 1980s, the imams had been trying to forge closer ties with Ayatollah Khomeini's Islamic government.  Despite being a Sunni Muslim, Kalim admired what had happened in 1979 in Iran - a predominantly Shia Muslim country. He viewed the revolution as having freed Islam from Western domination by overthrowing the Western-backed Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.  Kalim later said he believed he may have been ""partially responsible"" for the fatwa. ""I met a minister, a cabinet minister at the airport. In the VIP lounge, he asked me about the Satanic Verses and about Rushdie. And I told him what I knew about it, and he went back to the imam [Ayatollah Khomeini], I suppose, I presume, and the fatwa followed later that morning."" ""You feel proud of it?"" asked journalist Ludovic Kennedy in 1992, during an interview for BBC Radio 4's Beyond Belief series. ""Absolutely. Yes."" Journalist Yasmin Alibhai-Brown says Kalim also made the same claim to her around that time. She added: ""Some of the ayatollahs hadn't even read the book"". Ed Husain, a writer on religion and extremism who used to be a close friend of Ghayasuddin, has also spoken of the significance of the airport meeting.  In 2019, he told the BBC's podcast series Fatwa that Ayatollah Khomeini had not been minded to do anything about Sir Salman Rushdie because he was just a ""foreign author in another country"".  It had been the British imam, said Mr Husain, who had pushed Iran's autocratic political and religious leader - urging that he ""must do something for the Muslims"".  He said it meant a British Muslim had approached ""a fascist government asking for a theocratic leader to issue a fatwa on one of their citizens back in a free country"".  When asked if he was saying the fatwa had been requested from the UK, Mr Husain replied, ""yes"".   However, there are accounts which play down Kalim's influence.  ""Popular mythology"" maintains Kalim as the ""grand master of the fatwa, but this simply is not the case,"" states a biography of his travelling companion Ghayasuddin.  The book - A Very British Muslim Activist, as told by C Scott Jordan - says regular, abrupt and unscheduled meetings with ministers to discuss the week's hot topic ""were part and parcel"" of the Siddiquis' trips to Iran.  ""This week, as the buzz would have it, it appeared that Salman Rushdie's book had wound up on the desk of Ayatollah Khomeini and, being the leader of the Islamic state, it was incumbent upon him to act.""  The authorised biography says the minister, Mohammad Khatami - who would later become president - did ask Kalim's opinion, but says it is not known whether it was passed on to the ayatollah - or would have made any difference. ""To think a religious proclamation that had been carefully debated and reasoned by religious scholars had any influence from a foreign cheerleader in the few hours before its official release is nothing short of ridiculous,"" it says.  Kalim died in 1996. Speaking after the recent attack on Sir Salman, Kalim's son, Iqbal, says it was pure coincidence that his father happened to be in Iran around the time the fatwa was issued. The moment the Iranian minister approached him asking for background information ""was the first time Dad knew about"" a fatwa, he says. ""He never felt any involvement or responsibility for the fact the fatwa came out."" But Iqbal also says his father never expressed any regret about supporting the proclamation. British Muslims opposed to The Satanic Verses fell roughly into two camps when it first came out.  Firstly, there were those who fought the publication by calling for the UK legal system to change - extending the blasphemy law beyond Christianity to other faiths. They never got their way - instead the law was abolished in England and Wales in 2008, and in Scotland in 2021.  Then, there were those in the Siddiquis' camp - calling for something more fundamental from within Islam itself. Some men, who felt their views on the novel had not been listened to or respected by British society, began to present themselves as the legitimate representatives and gatekeepers of British Muslims.  Kalim was one of them. Late in 1989, he and his supporters noisily took over a meeting of several hundred Muslims in Manchester. The interruption came a day after the BBC had reported the result of a poll which had suggested only 35% of British Muslims supported the fatwa.  Kalim asked the audience if they agreed with the decree. ""Practically all those present raised their hands,"" wrote Kalim later. "" I had demonstrated, in the most dramatic fashion possible, the total unity and consensus that existed on this issue among Muslims in Britain."" For Kalim, Islamic institutions would better represent British Muslims. He went on to launch a Muslim Parliament in 1992, which became a forum for debate and discussion. But it declined after his death and ceased in 1997. According to its former deputy leader, Jahangir Mohammed, Kalim set up the organisation on the back of the popularity he gained as a result of the fatwa.  But Yasmin Alibhai-Brown says Kalim made an ""instinctive power grab"" and did not represent ordinary Muslims. The Muslim Parliament was ""a laughable thing"", she says. ""In what sense was it a parliament? It was a parliament without anybody voting."" Ghayasuddin is still alive, but not well enough to speak to the media. His son Asim - like Kalim's son, Iqbal - also says the Tehran airport encounter was a chance meeting and there is no evidence Kalim's views were passed on to Ayatollah Khomeini.  Asim says his father distanced himself from the fatwa decades ago - a sentiment echoed by Yasmin Alibhai-Brown. ""[Ghayasuddin] changed his mind and became a real fighter for free speech, it was a really courageous thing to do,"" she says.  Whether or not Kalim was the reason for Ayatollah Khomeini's edict that day in 1989, we are unlikely to ever know for sure. There were other factors swirling around the upper echelons of the Iranian leadership at that time.  Many Iranian citizens were disillusioned as the promises of the revolution 10 years before had not been fulfilled, while the supreme leader himself was terminally ill and still bitter after reluctantly agreeing to end a brutal eight-year war with Saddam Hussain's Iraq. Some journalists speculated whether the fatwa may have provided a convenient distraction from the embarrassment of agreeing to a ceasefire with Baghdad. After his death in June 1989, Ayatollah Khomeini's son told journalists his father had never read The Satanic Verses. His passing also meant the fatwa would be in place for eternity - as such a decree can only be reversed by the Islamic scholar who issued it.  In the late 1990s, Iran's government - led by President Khatami - backed away from the fatwa, declaring it would neither ""support nor hinder"" Salman Rushdie's assassination. But in 2017, the current Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei - when asked if the fatwa was still binding - said: ""The decree is as Imam Khomeini issued.""  Dozens of people died in protests over the novel, while others - including the book's Japanese translator - were killed after the fatwa. Sir Salman was forced to remain in hiding for almost a decade.  Now, more than three decades later, he has suffered life-changing injuries in an attack at a public event in New York state in the US.  Iran has ""categorically"" denied any link with the alleged perpetrator, instead blaming the writer himself. The young man accused of the stabbing - Hadi Matar, 24 - has not said whether his alleged actions were influenced by the fatwa.  He has reportedly said he has only read two pages of the Satanic Verses.

Tyson Fury calls on Anthony Joshua to sign fight contract by Thursday,"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 14:30:24 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/63073679,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/63073679?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Tyson Fury urges fellow British heavyweight Anthony Joshua to sign a contract for a world-title fight in December.,"This video can not be played ""Weâre slightly baffled"" - promoter Eddie Hearn talks to 5 Live Boxing about Fury v Joshua negotiations Tyson Fury has urged Anthony Joshua to ""give British fans what they want"" and sign a contract for a heavyweight world-title fight in December. WBC champion Fury, 34, had given fellow Briton Joshua, 32, an ultimatum to sign by Monday, but said on social media he has extended the deadline to Thursday. Joshua's promoter Eddie Hearn says he is ""baffled"" by Fury's latest demands. ""The ball is in your court, everything is done,"" said Fury. ""We have [broadcasters] BT, DAZN and ESPN all on the same page, they're happy with everything. ""If you have any dignity and pride about you, you'll get this contract signed today. ""I'm chucking you a massive bone but I know I can punch your face in so I'm willing to give you an opportunity. Let the British fans have what they want."" In an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live, Hearn responded by saying he had ""absolutely no idea"" what Fury was going to do next. ""I don't think we're a million miles away but I don't know really whether Tyson Fury wants this fight,"" added Hearn.  ""I think he just wants to fight Manuel Charr on 3 December, but I don't think anyone else wants that fight. Hopefully we can keep moving forward. ""We'll carry on and while there's hope, we won't stop trying.  ""From either side, I can't fault the process of trying to get done the biggest fight in British history. The only thing I can fault is we don't really know where we stand. ""One minute the fight's off, the fight's on; one minute he's retired, one minute he's fighting Manuel Charr. He's just made another offer to Derek Chisora. I don't know."" Joshua lost the WBA (Super), WBO and IBF belts to Oleksandr Usyk in September 2021 but Fury still holds the WBC title Joshua's team have already verbally accepted Fury's offer of a 60-40 purse split for a fight on 3 December, and television executives from BT Sport and streaming service DAZN were scheduled to meet on Monday. Last month, Joshua failed to regain the WBA (Super), WBO and IBF belts in a rematch with Oleksandr Usyk, losing on a split decision.  ""We are the B-side in this, whether right or wrong, because we accepted that position as challenger,"" added Hearn. ""We also accepted a date that was quite frankly to a disadvantage to Anthony Joshua, because he's just coming off a fight. ""But he was prepared to do it and he's still prepared to do it. We all really want to get it done. But I don't understand the deadlines that keep popping up on Instagram when these deadlines are not being applied in negotiations, just on social media. It doesn't really help anyone."" Fury's promoter Frank Warren says he does not know what is preventing the contract being signed. ""Look, we can't go on forever. Tyson is fighting on 3 December whatever happens but this is the fight we want and this is the fight we've worked hard to get over the line,"" he said on Talksport. ""I, for the life of me, don't know what is holding this up. At the end of the day, he [Joshua] is the boss. Instruct your team if you want the fight. ""I want them to pick up the phone, them to get the contract across, instruct their lawyers to speak to our lawyers and get it over the line. It's not rocket science."" Ukrainian Usyk, 35, said he plans to have three more fights before retiring, including a unification bout with Fury, but Joe Joyce is now the mandatory challenger for Usyk's WBO title after beating Joseph Parker on Saturday.

Why Indian fathers are embracing paternity leave,"Sun, 06 Mar 2022 00:37:57 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-60491095,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-60491095?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The pandemic and changing family structures have highlighted how young parents are struggling with childcare.,"It really does take a village to raise a child and Rehan Khan, 35, will tell you it doesn't get easier or less chaotic with time or experience. A marketing manager based in the southern Indian city of Bangalore, Mr Khan welcomed his third child during the lockdown in 2020. This time, his parenting experience was markedly different. The tech company he works with had increased paternity leave from one to three weeks. His wife, a contract worker for a US-based tech company, was able to take 15 weeks of leave. The first month was tough, Mr Khan said, as sleep patterns changed and the baby needed constant attention. ""My wife would be with the baby until 03:30 and then I would take over. Carry him around, play with him, rock him,"" he said. But it helped that both he and his wife worked from home, his parents stayed with them to help and they were financially well off enough to move into a bigger apartment. Mr Khan called the experience ""blissful"" but was quick to point out that stories like his were rare and one of privilege - as few Indian companies worked around a couple's childcare needs. ""I am very lucky to have a manager who's not an Indian, and his boss is American. It makes a difference because they are much more sensitive about this,"" he said. India's federal and most state governments allow married male employees to take a fortnight's leave at the time of, or within six months after, the birth of a child. In comparison, Indian women working in state-run and private companies are entitled to 26 weeks of paid leave, one of the longest in the world. But there is still no nationwide policy for paternity leave. Some private companies have begun to offer paternity leave for fathers, adoptive parents and LGBT couples. Tech companies give a decent amount of paternity leave to help them recruit and retain talent. Drinks giant Diageo allows all eligible employees a 26-week parental leave irrespective of gender or sexual orientation. Last month India-born Twitter chief executive Parag Agrawal's announcement that he would take a few weeks off after the birth of his second child had Indians talking about paternity leave. Indian tech companies and start-ups that offered generous leaves highlighted their policies. In India, joint families - where multiple generations form one household - have played a significant part in childcare. But this is slowly changing with more children being born in nuclear families. Himanshu Dhanda, a federal government worker, said a cultural shift was visible in his current workplace where senior male colleagues called him ""lucky"" for being able to take leave for his child's birth which they said wasn't available in their time. Mr Dhanda's father, a retired government employee, had been mocked for trying to take paternity leave three decades ago. ""He told me his colleagues said, 'It's the mother who'll feed the child. What is your work there?'"" Mr Dhanda recounted. His father was able to take just seven days. Mr Dhanda said that a month of paid leave for fathers would help a lot. ""Especially with people like us who have no experience, it is very challenging. A lot of unexpected things happen. You are just running around figuring things out like the baby's sleep, the mother's physical and emotional health,"" he said. Sreeparna Chattopadhyay, an associate professor of sociology at Pune's Flame University, believes India should have a statutory shared parental leave policy, similar to Sweden's, which would be completely inclusive and not limited to biological parents. ""If you don't have something enshrined in a statutory way, then there is really no obligation to carry it out, right? And [with its current policy] the state is signalling in some way that they care about the fact that parenting is a shared responsibility,"" she said.

Anthony Albanese: Australia's new PM sworn in ahead of Quad meeting,"Mon, 23 May 2022 01:04:00 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-61546470,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-61546470?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Two days after his election win, Anthony Albanese will fly to meet leaders of the US, India and Japan.","Anthony Albanese has been sworn in as Australia's new leader and will fly immediately to an international summit. Mr Albanese's Labor Party defeated Scott Morrison's conservative government in an election on Saturday. It remains unclear whether Mr Albanese will form a majority or govern with the support of crossbenchers. The prime minister left for Tokyo on Monday to meet the leaders of the so-called Quad nations - the US, India and Japan. Earlier in the day, he was sworn in with four key cabinet members, including new Foreign Minister Penny Wong, who is travelling with him to Japan. Richard Marles is the new deputy prime minister and employment minister, Jim Chalmers is treasurer, and Katy Gallagher is attorney-general and finance minister. It is Australia's first Labor government in almost a decade. The party has won 74 lower house seats but counting continues to determine whether they can get the 76 needed to form a majority. But the primary vote for both major parties fell - almost a third of Australians put the Greens, independents and other minor parties as their first preference. The Quad group is seen as largely aiming to counter growing Chinese influence in the Indo-Pacific region. It will meet on Tuesday following recent diplomatic tensions in the Pacific, after the Solomon Islands last month signed a security pact with China. The US and Australia hold fears the deal could allow China to build a naval base there. In a statement ahead of the meeting, Mr Albanese said: ""The Quad Leaders' Summit brings together four leaders of great liberal democracies - Australia, Japan, India, and the United States of America - in support of a free, open and resilient Indo-Pacific."" Ms Wong signalled that they would bring ""new energy and much more to the table"" on climate action, after ""a lost decade"". Climate change played a huge role in the election result, with a surge in support for candidates wanting urgent action. Mr Morrison's government had committed to a 2030 emissions reduction target of 26%-28% - about half that of the UK and US. Mr Albanese's government has a target of 43%. The Greens are expected to pick up four lower seats, adding to seven climate-focused independents. They could put pressure on Labor to take even stronger action, especially if it fails to reach a majority. Mr Morrison's unpopularity and his party's stance on climate have been blamed by some Liberal MPs for wiping out their vote.  Losses included senior party figures, including deputy leader Josh Frydenberg, in traditional Liberal strongholds. Mr Morrison stepped down as party leader on Saturday and former defence minister Peter Dutton is the favourite to succeed him. Mr Dutton - from the party's right - has been a controversial figure at times. Some question whether he could rebuild Liberal support in more progressive, metropolitan areas. It's been a busy few days for Mr Albanese. Since Saturday he has won an election, been sworn in as PM, and is now on his way to the Quad.  It's fitting that Australia's new leader would hit the ground running. There's a lot to get to domestically and globally.  Mr Albanese has said the Quad alliance is an absolute priority for Australia. This meeting comes at a crucial and tense time in the region with a growing Chinese influence that's making Australia and its allies nervous.  The recent China defence deal with the Solomon Islands is seen as a threat to Australia's status as a strategic partner to Pacific nations. But there's a fine balance Mr Albanese needs to strike.  He needs to address China's expansion in the Indo-Pacific while also repairing a relationship with Beijing that's fractured significantly since the beginning of the pandemic when Australia called for an investigation into the origins of the Covid virus.  China is now a very angry strategic trade partner. And the other Quad members will need to be reassured that Mr Albanese has a plan to manage the complicated relationship. The prime minister says this trip is a chance for Australia to send a message globally that it is changing its approach on crucial policies such as climate change.  This is now being called the climate election. Mr Albanese wants to tell his allies and the world that under his leadership they'll be dealing with a new and more globally-engaged Australia.

"Covid vaccines not linked to deaths, major US study finds","Tue, 08 Mar 2022 01:17:50 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-60653946,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-60653946?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The CDC says 92% of reported side effects after the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are mild.,"A major study of vaccine side-effects in the US found no link between two Covid jabs and the number of deaths recorded after vaccination. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said 92% of reported side-effects after the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were mild. About 4,500 people died after being vaccinated, in the US, up to June 2021. But no unusual patterns in the data were detected that might suggest a link to the vaccine itself.  Study author Dr Tom Shimabukuro said: ""[It's] reassuring that reactions to both mRNA vaccines are generally mild and subside after one or two days - confirming reports from clinical trials and post-authorisation monitoring."" Researchers looked at ""adverse events"" from nearly 300 million vaccine doses given in the US between December 2020 and June 2021.  Members of the public, healthcare providers and drug companies can report any possible side-effect, using the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), run by the CDC and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A second method, V-safe, allows individuals to fill out a survey on their smartphone in the months after vaccination.  Both systems rely on individuals deciding to self-report an adverse event. The results of the study are published in the Lancet medical journal: Other serious events, including a form of heart inflammation known as myocarditis, have already been identified following both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccinations, although that side-effect is very rare.  Because Covid jabs were originally authorised in the United States under emergency-use provisions, healthcare providers are required to report all deaths following vaccination, whether a doctor suspects a ""plausible"" link or not. About 4,500 deaths were recorded in the six months to June 2021, more than 80% among people aged 60 and over.  ""The rapid pace at which Covid-19 vaccines were administered under emergency use, especially among older populations, was unprecedented,"" the CDC's Dr David Shay said. ""Due to their age, this group already has a higher baseline mortality rate than the general population and our results follow similar patterns of death rates for people in this age group following other adult vaccinations."" The researchers said less than 1% of people who filled out the V-safe survey had sought any medical care following vaccination. Dr Elizabeth Phillips, a professor of medicine, at Vanderbilt University, who was not involved in the study, said: ""Reassuringly, the six-month VAERS data supports that - although approximately one in 1,000 individuals vaccinated may have an adverse effect, most of these are non-serious. ""For adverse events of special interest, it is reassuring that there were no unexpected [safety] signals other than myocarditis and anaphylaxis, already known to be associated with mRNA vaccines.""

£400 energy payment: Fears renters with bills included will miss out,"Tue, 02 Aug 2022 23:01:02 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62375576,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62375576?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Where a tenant's bills are included in their rent the energy rebate will be paid to their landlord.,"Tenants whose bills are included in their rent could miss out on the government's Â£400 energy rebate because it is paid to their landlord, charities have warned. Housing charity Shelter said this group were ""at the mercy of their landlord passing on this much-needed support"".  An estimated 585,000 households - 13% of private renters - have energy bills included in their rent. The government said it expected landlords to pass on the discount.  The National Residential Landlords Association (NRLA) also said that where tenants incurred the cost of increased energy bills, the discount should be passed on to them by their landlord.  However, a spokesperson pointed out there would be cases where all-inclusive rents had been set without reflecting the recent surge in energy costs.  ""The government needs to ensure that its scheme recognises such cases where it is the landlord who is ultimately paying the cost of increased bills, rather than the tenant,"" the spokesperson added.  The typical household energy bill could hit Â£3,615 a year in January, up from Â£1,400 a year in October 2021, according to a forecast from consultancy Cornwall Insight.  The government has announced a package of measures to help households with the rising cost of living, including a Â£400 discount on energy bills.  Last week the government revealed details of how people in England, Scotland and Wales would receive the payment.  The Treasury is still in discussion with Stormont ministers about how to make the payment to households in Northern Ireland. The money will be paid in six instalments, with a discount of Â£66 applied to energy bills in October and November, and Â£67 a month from December to March 2023. How the money is received will depend on how you pay your bill.  However, for tenants whose energy bills are included in their rent, their landlord would receive the discount as they are the bill payer.  Helen, 25, rents a room in a four-bed house in Leicester with bills included.  She is worried that if she asks her landlord to pass the Â£400 payment on to her he will increase her rent when her contract is up for renewal later this year.  ""I'm leaning towards not rocking the boat because I'm dreading that conversation about renewing and what my new rent will be for the next six months,"" she told the BBC.  Helen, who did not want to give her surname, is a PhD student and her stipend will increase by just 2% in September - well below the rate prices are rising, with UK inflation hitting 9.4% in June.  If her rent increased she said it would be ""a real stretch"" to cover her other living costs.  As she shares a house with strangers, Helen said it was also difficult to discuss the situation with her housemates, who she would have to share the payment with. She did not know if they would feel the same as her.  When it comes to utility bills, government guidance states that landlords who have a domestic electricity contract with a licensed supplier and then resell the electricity to their tenant, based on usage, must comply with maximum resale price rules.  This means landlords are not allowed to make a profit on energy they are reselling.  Landlords with a domestic electricity connection where a fixed cost for energy is included in the rent ""should also be passing on the discounted payments to tenants"", the government said.  But charities have raised concerns that landlords will not pass on the saving to their tenants.  Are you a renter worried about missing out on the Â£400 energy rebate? Please email: haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk. Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist. You can also get in touch via WhatsApp: +44 7756 165803 and Twitter: @BBC_HaveYourSay ""There's no specific legal obligation for landlords to pass on this support but they aren't allowed to overcharge tenants for the energy they've used or make a profit on it,"" Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said.  ""This could be the case if they pocket the government support and continue to charge the same rate for utilities.""  ""Landlords can only charge for energy used, the standing charge and VAT. So, it's worth making a note of how much energy you're using to make sure you're not paying more than you should,"" she added.  Ms Neate said it was ""unfair that those at the sharp end of this crisis could miss out on this much-needed support"" and urged the government to make sure it went ""to the people who need it the most"".  Gillian Cooper, head of energy policy at Citizens Advice, said there was no clear guidance on how landlords should pass on the discount ""or any law to make sure they do"".  ""We're worried that renters could fall through the cracks and miss out on extra cash,"" she added.  Dan Wilson Craw, deputy director of campaign group Generation Rent, said: ""A lot of landlords have already raised the rent to take account of higher energy bills and there's no easy way for tenants to ask them to pass on the Â£400 grant if they don't want to - threatening to move out is one approach but that is difficult when rent on a new property could be much higher."" He suggested tenants could ask their landlord to take into account the Â£400 rebate the next time they tried to increase their rent.  But he added that until Parliament passed the Renters Reform Bill, tenants could still be evicted without reason if they complained.  However, some landlords who have not increased their tenants' rent said they did not think they should have to pass on the Â£400 discount.  Annette Munro, 59, rents out a flat in London with bills included and believes landlords should only have to pass on the rebate if they have hiked rents due to rising energy costs.  She said the monthly energy bill for her property had increased from Â£90 to Â£267 but she has not put up the rent for several years because her tenants are ""already struggling"".  ""If landlords haven't put [the rent] up and have absorbed that cost because they like their tenants and they want to keep them, then I think that they should be able to take the Â£400,"" she told the BBC.

Hamida Banu: Missing India woman found in Pakistan 'can't wait to go home',"Sun, 07 Aug 2022 00:08:19 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-62421848,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-62421848?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Hamida Banu had been trafficked to Pakistan 20 years ago by an agent promising her a job in Dubai.,"An Indian woman who was missing for 20 years has been found in Pakistan with the help of a video on social media. Hamida Banu left India in 2002 after a recruitment agent promised to get her the job of a cook in Dubai. Instead, she says, she was tricked and trafficked to Pakistan. Ms Banu's family in India's Mumbai told BBC Marathi that they spent two decades trying to find her - and they finally managed to do so because of two men, one in India and the other in Pakistan. The neighbouring countries share a tense relationship, which often makes it difficult for Indians and Pakistanis to travel across the border. In Ms Banu's case, she was also hobbled by a lack of financial resources and know-how.  But through the years, she never stopped yearning to meet her children. Finally, in July this year, Waliullah Maroof, a social media activist, interviewed Ms Banu and uploaded the video online. An Indian journalist named Khalfan Shaikh - who lives in Mumbai - shared the video with his followers, which led to Ms Banu's family finding her. The two men then helped set up a video call between Ms Banu and her daughter Yasmin Shaikh. ""How are you? Did you recognise me? Where were you all these years?"" Yasmin is seen asking in the emotional video. ""Don't ask me where I was, and how I have been. I missed you all so much. I didn't stay here willingly, I had no other choice,"" Ms Banu replies. In the interview with Mr Maroof, Ms Banu says that she had been financially supporting her four children in India after her husband's death. She had worked as a cook in Doha, Qatar, Dubai and Saudi Arabia in the past without any problems. In 2002, she approached a recruitment agent to help arrange a job in Dubai. The woman asked her to pay 20,000 rupees ($250; Â£200). Ms Banu says in the video that instead of Dubai, she was brought to Hyderabad city in Pakistan - there, she says she was detained in a house for three months. Sometime over the years, she married a man who lived in Karachi city - but he died during the Covid-19 pandemic. Ms Banu now lives with her stepson. Yasmin says that in her mother's previous stints abroad, she would call them regularly. But after she left in 2002, they waited months for a phone call. Finally, they approached the agent who had organised the trip. ""She told us that our mother was well and didn't want to speak with us. We kept returning to ask questions about our mother, and then she [the agent] suddenly vanished,"" Yasmin adds.  Mr Maroof, an imam at a local mosque in Karachi, says he first met her around 15 years ago when she moved to his neighbourhood and opened a small shop. ""I have been seeing her since my childhood. She always looked distressed,"" he says.  For years, Mr Maroof had used his social media accounts to help women from Bangladesh - who had been trafficked to Pakistan - find their families. After Ms Banu's second husband died, she often asked Mr Marroof's mother to persuade him to help her as well. Mr Maroof says he sympathised with her, but was hesitant because of the frosty relations between the countries. ""My friends advised me to stay away from India, suggesting that it might land me in trouble. However, I felt so bad for her that I couldn't resist it anymore,"" he said, saying that he doesn't take any money for his efforts. In the interview, Ms Banu had mentioned her Mumbai address and the names of her children.  When Mr Shaikh shared the video, it was spotted by Yasmin's son, Aman. The 18-year-old had never met his grandmother, as he was born after she left, but Yasmin recognised her immediately. Mr Maroof says that officials at the Indian High Commission in Pakistan have contacted him and asked Ms Banu to submit an application with details of the case so they can begin the process of repatriation. But he isn't sure how much time it will take.  In the meantime, Ms Banu is counting the days until she can return home. She says she had almost lost hope of ever meeting her children again. Across the border, the emotions are similar, Yasmin says. ""We waited for her for 20 years. I am so happy now. I can't stop smiling ever since I saw that video. It's a strange feeling.""

Ghislaine Maxwell appeals against sex trafficking conviction,"Fri, 08 Jul 2022 00:00:51 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-62088862,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-62088862?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Ghislaine Maxwell formally filed her appeal nine days after her conviction for child sex trafficking.,"Ghislaine Maxwell has appealed against her child sex trafficking conviction and the 20-year prison term she was handed by a US judge last month.  Maxwell, 60, was convicted in December of recruiting and trafficking four teenage girls for abuse by her then-boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein took his own life in a New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting his own trial. Maxwell's appeal process was expected and will likely last several months.  During her trial, her lawyers argued that she was being scapegoated for Epstein's crimes, calling her friendship with the financier the ""biggest mistake of her life"".  Judge Alison J Nathan rejected attempts to throw out the case, including after Maxwell's lawyers argued that one juror had failed to inform the court that he had been abused as a child.  She also rejected arguments that Maxwell had not been allowed to prepare adequately for her trial, and that prosecutors had waited too long to bring their case against her.  Pronouncing the sentence in June, Judge Nathan said Maxwell's conduct had been ""heinous and predatory"" and that she ""played a pivotal role"" in Epstein's abuse. As well as jail time, the judge imposed a fine of $750,000 (Â£610,000). Her lawyer had asked for a sentence of no more than five years.  It remains unclear on what grounds Maxwell plans to appeal. Her lawyers were not required to give a reason in Thursday's legal filing.  Addressing her victims in the Manhattan courthouse in June, Maxwell said she empathised with them, adding that she hoped her prison sentence would allow the victims ""peace and finality"". Maxwell has been in custody since her arrest in July 2020, held mostly at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center. The case against the British former socialite has been one of the highest-profile since the emergence of the #MeToo movement, which encouraged women to speak out about sexual abuse.  This video can not be played Watch: 'We still want answers from Maxwell' The crimes of Epstein, who mixed with some of the world's most famous people, were first reported in the media in 2005 and he served prison time in Florida in 2008-09 on a state charge of procuring a minor for prostitution. Following numerous lawsuits, he was arrested again in 2019 in a federal case in New York.   At least eight women wrote letters to Maxwell's judge during her trial describing how they had suffered.

Real Madrid 3-1 Paris St-Germain (3-2 agg): Karim Benzema hat-trick inspires superb Real fightback,"Wed, 09 Mar 2022 22:48:17 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60666638,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60666638?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Karim Benzema scores a superb second-half hat-trick as Real Madrid produce a stirring fightback at a raucous Bernabeu to reach the Champions League quarter-finals at the expense of Paris St-Germain.," Last updated on 9 March 20229 March 2022.From the section Champions Leaguecomments656 Karim Benzema scored a superb second-half hat-trick as Real Madrid produced a stirring fightback at a raucous Bernabeu to reach the Champions League quarter-finals at the expense of Paris St-Germain.  Kylian Mbappe's first-half goal had given PSG a deserved two-goal aggregate lead and looked to have put Mauricio Pochettino's side well on course for the last eight.  However, a mistake by PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma proved the catalyst for a dramatic recovery with Benzema turning home after the Italian dawdled in possession.  Luka Modric's driving run and intricate pass made Benzema's second as he levelled the tie against a clearly panicked PSG, and as the visitors attempted to regroup the 34-year-old drove a low effort into the bottom right corner seconds after the restart to settle the tie. Until Donnarumma's error PSG had been in complete control.  Marco Verratti was slick and dominant in midfield, while Neymar and Lionel Messi worked themselves into some dangerous positions as the hosts struggled to contain their more fluent opponents. Mbappe in particular was electric, racing on to a pass from Neymar to open the scoring against the side he has been heavily tipped to join in the summer when his contract at PSG expires. Either side of that the 23-year-old tormented the Real defence, twice having goals correctly disallowed for offside but showing his predatory instincts nonetheless. A surge of acceleration also saw him burst past Real's Eder Militao and only a brilliant covering challenge from David Alaba prevented him from adding to his tally.  Mbappe's influence was such that he received warm applause from the home support as he got up after appearing to be hurt in a tackle, but the real damage to his and PSG's long-standing aspirations in the competition were still to come.  Benzema's 17-minute treble ensured PSG suffered another painful elimination from a competition that has become an obsession since they moved into Qatari ownership in 2011. And after reaching the final and semi-finals in consecutive seasons this feels like a considerable backwards step for a squad that has been expensively assembled but remains prone to monumental collapses in this competition. This felt every bit as shattering as their 6-1 thrashing by Barcelona in 2017, their last-16 defeat by Manchester United in 2019, and was even more remarkable given they had not lost a Champions League away game after leading at half-time since 2001. While PSG are runaway leaders in Ligue 1 and have been crowned French champions in seven of the past nine seasons, domestic success is not the barometer Pochettino will be judged by come the end of the season.  And alarmingly the Argentine and his stunned players were unable to provide any adequate response once the tide had turned in this contest.  Julian Draxler and Angel di Maria were only introduced once the Parisiens were chasing the game, and aside from a late Messi free-kick which dipped just over, they were unable to conjure a single clear-cut goalscoring opportunity as they meekly exited the tournament.

Casemiro: Manchester United agree £70m deal to sign Real Madrid midfielder,"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 19:53:03 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62608356,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62608356?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Manchester United reach an agreement with Real Madrid to sign Brazil midfielder Casemiro in a deal worth up to £70m.," Last updated on 19 August 202219 August 2022.From the section Man Utdcomments3258 Manchester United have reached an agreement with Real Madrid to sign Brazil midfielder Casemiro in a deal worth up to £70m. The 30-year-old has been with Real since 2013, winning three La Liga titles and five Champions Leagues. The fee is an initial £60m plus £10m in add-ons and Casemiro will sign a four-year deal with the option of one more. United are bottom of the Premier League and host Liverpool at Old Trafford on Monday. Casemiro is set to become one of the United's top earners once he completes his move, and will be United's fourth signing after midfielder Christian Eriksen, full-back Tyrell Malacia from Feyenoord and defender Lisandro Martinez. After talks to sign Juventus' Adrien Rabiot collapsed over the player's demands, United have turned their attention to Casemiro as they look to address weaknesses in Erik ten Hag's midfield. This deal almost certainly spells the end of Manchester United's pursuit of Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong. Whilst the club are not completely ruling out signing the Dutchman at some point in the future, they admit it is highly unlikely they would get De Jong and Casemiro in the same window. The transfer will come too late for Casemiro to be involved in Monday's game against Liverpool. Casemiro's impact can be seen by looking at Opta statistics to compare his figures against those of other central midfielders in La Liga last season. The Brazil international ranked first for successful blocks, second for tackles made behind Barcelona's Sergio Busquets, and also came third overall for possession won. Real Sociedad's Mikel Merino was first and Busquets runner-up in the latter category. He also contributed to Real's attacks, ranking fifth for forward passes and joint-sixth for shots among the league's central midfielders. Casemiro spent a season away from the Bernabeu on loan at Portuguese side Porto in 2014-15 but returned to Spain the following season after Real activated his buy-back clause. He has made 222 appearances for the Spanish giants and scored 24 goals. ""I lived the most wonderful story I ever thought of,"" Casemiro wrote on social media on Saturday morning. ""I hope to return someday to where it will always be my home. Not even in a thousand lifetimes I will be able to return to Real Madrid and to Madridismo all that you have given me."" BBC Sport football reporter Simon Stone Casemiro's four-year contract is heavily performance related, specifically around Champions League qualification, and will put him amongst Manchester United's highest earners but the club are denying reports in Spain that the Brazilian is doubling his salary. United sources say they have admired the player for some considerable time and that he was high on their list of targets. They moved for him once it became clear he was available and he wanted to move to Old Trafford. The club feel it strengthens an area new manager Erik ten Hag identified as a priority. United feel his professionalism, intelligence and strength of character are key attributes which will bring immediate benefits. These comments are now closed.

"‘I was a dentist before Ukraine war, I want to help others’","Fri, 12 Aug 2022 05:30:23 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-62463381,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-62463381?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,A Ukrainian refugee family who are dentists are highlighting barriers preventing them from practising.,"This video can not be played A family of refugees who were dentists before the Russian invasion of Ukraine has been highlighting barriers preventing them from practising in the UK.  A recent BBC investigation exposed dentistry shortages across the UK.   The regulator has also confirmed a backlog in exam places that allow some overseas dentists to register and practise in the UK.  Anastasiia Saviska worked along aside her husband and her father as dentists in Ukraine. They had their own family practice before having to flee the country.  Anastasiia and her family are currently being hosted by the Johnston family from County Down in Northern Ireland.  A backlog in exam places mean delays before they can do the Overseas Registration Exams (ORE) that would allow them to practise in the UK. The General Dental Council (GDC) said: ""The ORE reopened earlier this year after being suspended for almost two years due to Covid. That suspension has increased the current demand for exam places.   âWe are working through that, but the exam is also subject to outdated and inflexible legislation which effectively prevents us from offering more places."" The GDC added: ""This legislation is in the process of being reformed and we look forward to being able to run a more efficient system in future.â Video journalist: Niall McCracken âI was a dentist before war, I want to help othersâ Video, 00:02:39âI was a dentist before war, I want to help othersâ Up Next.

"Street harassment will end in charges, Crown Prosecution Service vows","Mon, 08 Aug 2022 00:29:03 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-62442061,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-62442061?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Even one-off incidents could be classed as offences, new Crown Prosecution Service guidance says.","People responsible for sexual harassment in the street can - and will be - charged, new guidance to prosecutors in England and Wales says.  The Crown Prosecution Service suggests even one-off incidents of ""cat-calling"" could be classed as offences under existing public order laws.  The CPS warned of charges for ""sexually threatening or abusive"" comments.  ""Feeling safe should not be a luxury for women,"" said Siobhan Blake, CPS lead for rape and serious offences.  The government is also considering stronger laws on street harassment. It has begun a consultation on extending existing legislation by making it an offence to cause ""intentional harassment, alarm or distress"" to someone because of their sex. However, the Home Office at present believes existing criminal offences adequately deal with abusive public behaviour.  The CPS said it had decided to review the advice it gives staff on the current laws because of a renewed focus on women's safety in public places, following cases such as the murder of Sarah Everard last year.  The new guidance stresses public order laws can be used to prosecute, even when someone makes ""one-off, less serious comments"". ""Examples could include unwanted sexual comments... where it is not possible to prove that the perpetrator had an intention to cause harassment, alarm, or distress,"" the guidance states. In cases of unwanted touching in the street or public transport, police do not have to prove what happened was ""intentionally sexual"", says the guidance.  The CPS also highlights a new law banning voyeurism while a person is breastfeeding a child, and a ban on up-skirting, which came into effect in 2019.  Cases of ""cyber-flashing"" - where offenders send lewd messages or sexual images via bluetooth to people nearby -should be handled in the same way as misuse of social media.  This would involve considering whether the messages were offensive and intended to cause distress.  Stalking and harassment laws should only be used when there are repeated attempts by an offender to target a victim, the guidance says.  The CPS says it believes a clear approach to abusive behaviour in the street will help victims feel more comfortable about making an allegation.  Ms Blake said almost three quarters of women had been subjected to ""this disgusting behaviour"".  ""It is equally concerning that so few incidents of sexual harassment in public are reported,"" she said.  ""The law is clear that if someone exposes themselves, tries to take inappropriate pictures or makes you feel threatened on the street, these are crimes and should not be dismissed."" ""Everyone has the right to travel on public transport, dance at a festival or walk the streets without fear of harassment.""

Covid: Boris Johnson WhatsApp messages requested by inquiry,"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 15:08:09 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-63403844,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-63403844?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"The messages, alongside other documents, are part of the probe into political decision-making.","The Covid public inquiry has asked to see Boris Johnson's WhatsApp messages during his time as prime minister as part of its probe into decision-making. Counsel for the inquiry, Hugo Keith KC, said the messages had been requested alongside thousands of other documents. He said a major focus of this part of the inquiry was understanding how the ""momentous"" decisions to impose lockdowns and restrictions were taken. The revelations came as he set out the details of how this module will work. The inquiry is being broken down into different sections - or modules as they are being called. The preliminary hearing for module one, looking at how well prepared the UK was, took place last month. Monday marked the start of the preliminary hearing for module two, which is looking at the political decision-making. Mr Keith said this allowed the inquiry to take a ""targeted approach"". He said it would look at whether lives could have been saved by introducing an earlier lockdown at the start of 2020. But he also said it would assess the quality of advice ministers received, and whether too much weight was given to modelling. In his opening address, Mr Keith said the crisis placed ""extraordinary levels of strain"" on the UK's health, care, financial and educational systems and businesses, on top of individual bereavements. He said its impact will be felt for ""decades to come"", adding: ""The pandemic has led to financial and economic turmoil. ""It has disrupted economies and education systems, and put unprecedented pressure on national health systems. Jobs and businesses have been destroyed and livelihoods taken away. ""The disease has caused widespread and long-term physical and mental illness, grief and untold misery. ""Its impact will be felt worldwide, including in the United Kingdom, for decades to come."" The identity of the core participants for this module were also unveiled. These are the individuals and organisations which will have enhanced rights to see documents and make submissions. Alongside government departments, they will also include a host of groups representing some of the most vulnerable in society, including people with disabilities, children, women at risk of domestic violence and those who developed ""long Covid"". Mr Keith said the pandemic ""reached out and affected almost every person"" but its impact was not equally felt. He said it was important to assess whether the risks these groups faced was properly taken into account. A further preliminary hearing for the module will take place in early 2023, with public hearings starting in the summer. These are scheduled to last for about eight weeks.

FedEx Cup: Rory McIlroy beats Scottie Scheffler & Sungjae Im by one stroke to win third title,"Sun, 28 Aug 2022 23:15:03 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/golf/62710390,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/golf/62710390?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Norhtern Ireland's Rory McIlroy beats Scottie Scheffler and Sungjae Im by one shot to win third FedEx Cup.,"McIlroy (right) receives the FedEx Cup from PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan Tour Championship - final leaderboard -21 R McIlroy (NI); -20 S Scheffler (US), SJ Im (Kor); -18 X Schauffele (US); -17 M Homa (US), J Thomas (US); -16 P Cantlay (US), S Straka (Aut) Selected others: -13 H Matsuyama (Jpn); -12 J Spieth (US); -11 J Rahm (Spa), M Fitzpatrick (Eng); -9 C Smith (Aus); -8 C Morikawa (US) Leaderboard Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy became the first player to win the FedEx Cup three times after a remarkable last day at the PGA Tour's Tour Championship. The 33-year-old overturned Scottie Scheffler's six-shot lead to finish one clear of the American and Sungjae Im. Four-time major winner McIlroy carded a four-under 66 to pip the world number one and the South Korean on 21 under. McIlroy receives $18m (Â£15.36m) in prize money for his win at East Lake, his fifth title of the season. Facing LIV players at BMW PGA Championship will be 'hard to stomach' - McIlroy ""What a week, what a day,"" McIlroy told Sky Sports. ""I feel like Scottie deserves at least half of this. He's a hell of a competitor. It was an honour to battle with him."" Scheffler started the week with a six-shot advantage over McIlroy as players began the season-ending event on staggered scores, determined by their respective positions in the FedEx Cup standings. After a suspension of play during Saturday's third round because of lightning, 26-year-old Scheffler led by just one when play resumed on Sunday morning, but extended his lead to six strokes before the final round began later that day. The pair bogeyed the first hole of their final rounds and an out-of-sorts Scheffler dropped further shots on the fourth and sixth.  In contrast, a free-flowing McIlroy responded to his opening bogey by making birdie on the third and picking up three more shots in succession from the fifth. That set the tone for the day and McIlroy led by one by the time they got to the 18th tee as the conclusion to the PGA Tour season came down to its very last hole.  Both players hit good drives but McIlroy, having been largely imperious all day, pull-hooked his approach and could only make a par five. Scheffler could not take advantage though, hitting the last of a series of modest bunker shots that meant the Masters champion also only parred the closing hole to sign for a ragged 73. He shared second with rising star Im, 24, who shot 66 and had his own chances to claim the title. McIlroy has now earned a total of $43m from his three FedEx Cup victories ""I didn't really give myself much of a chance teeing off today. I thought six behind was going to be really tough to make up, but my good play and Scottie's not-so-great play meant it was a ball game going into the back nine,"" McIlroy added. McIlroy has been one of the PGA Tour's most influential presences during golf's ongoing power struggle, and was one of the leading voices in a meeting held earlier this month by the tour's top players to discuss the threat of LIV Golf. Following his triumph, he said: ""I believe in the game of golf, I believe in this tour in particular, I believe in the players on this tour. ""It's the greatest place in the world to play golf, bar none, and I've played all over the world. ""This is an incredibly proud moment for me, but it should also be an incredibly proud moment for the PGA Tour. They have had some hard times this year, but we are getting through it and that was a spectacle out there today. ""Two of the best players in the world going head-to-head for the biggest prize on the PGA Tour, and I hope everyone at home enjoyed that.""  McIlroy said the FedEx Cup victory would help ""soften the blow"" after he was edged out at the 150th Open Championship, where he shared the lead after 54 holes but finished third behind Australia's Cameron Smith. ""St Andrews was really hard for me. It was a tough one to get over,"" he said. ""This softens the blow a little bit. It doesn't make it that much easier to get over, but it's great to end the season on a high note like this.""

Lauren Price: Welsh Olympic champion wins on professional boxing debut at Wembley Arena,"Sat, 11 Jun 2022 21:15:55 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/61769719,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/61769719?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Wales' Olympic champion Lauren Price makes a winning start to her professional career with an impressive victory over Valgerdur Gudstensdottir.,"Lauren Price (right) won 60-54 on the referee's scorecard against Valgerdur Gudstensdottir of Iceland Wales' Olympic champion Lauren Price made a winning start to her professional career with an impressive victory over Valgerdur Gudstensdottir. Price, 27, won every round of the six-round bout at London's Wembley Arena. The contest was on the undercard of British cruiserweight Richard Riakporhe's IBF world title eliminator against Italy's Fabio Turchi. ""I really enjoyed it, it's the first one and I'm buzzing, let's go again,"" Price told Sky Sports. ""I wanted to relax and I didn't want to rush my work. It was great to get six rounds under my belt. I enjoyed it, a win is a win. Thank you to everyone who supported me, bought tickets and came to watch."" In August, in Tokyo, Price became the first Welsh fighter, male or female, to win an Olympic Games boxing gold medal. Lauren Price won Olympic gold for Great Britain in August at the Tokyo Games, beating China's Li Qian in the middleweight final A glittering amateur career also saw her win a world championship, as well as Commonwealth Games gold in 2018 in Australia's Gold Coast and this was a hugely impressive start to life as a professional, fighting at welterweight. Earlier this week, she said she hoped to continue a great few days for Welsh sport after Joe Cordina claimed the IBF super-featherweight title and the men's football team beat Ukraine 1-0 to qualify for the World Cup. Price, born in Newport and who lives in Ystrad Mynach, demonstrated good footwork from the off, with Iceland's Gudstensdottir, fighting in the United Kingdom for the first time, struggling to land anything. A powerful right hook in the first round from Price was accurate with Gudstensdottir facing problems with Price's quick combinations landing regularly. By the third round Price was in complete control, comfortably picking off her opponent, who had won five and lost two of her previous seven bouts. It became a question of whether Gudstensdottir would go the six-round distance. She took a lot of punishment towards the end of the fifth but managed to survive to hear the final bell.

Ukraine war: Western agents seek to get inside Putin's head,"Sun, 20 Mar 2022 00:49:15 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60807134,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60807134?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine shook the West. Now its leaders are trying to predict his next move.,"Russia's leader Vladimir Putin is trapped in a closed world of his own making, Western spies believe. And that worries them. For years they have sought to get inside Mr Putin's mind, to better understand his intentions. With Russian troops seemingly bogged down in Ukraine, the need to do so has become all the more necessary as they try to work out how he will react under pressure. Understanding his state of mind will be vital to avoid escalating the crisis into even more dangerous territory. There has been speculation that Russia's leader was ill, but many analysts believe he has actually become isolated and closed off to any alternative views. His isolation has been evident in pictures of his meetings, such as when he met President Emmanuel Macron, the pair at far ends of a long table. It was also evident in Mr Putin's meeting with his own national security team on the eve of war. Mr Putin's initial military plan looked like something devised by a KGB officer, one Western intelligence official explains. It had been created, they say, by a tight ""conspiratorial cabal"" with an emphasis on secrecy. But the result was chaos. Russian military commanders were not ready and some soldiers went over the border without knowing what they were doing.   Western spies, through sources they will not discuss, knew more about those plans than many inside Russia's leadership. But now they face a new challenge - understanding what Russia's leader will do next. And that is not easy. ""The challenge of understanding the Kremlin's moves is that Putin is the single decision-maker in Moscow,"" explains John Sipher, who formerly ran the CIA's Russia operations. And even though his views are often made clear through public statements, knowing how he will act on them is difficult intelligence challenge. ""It is extremely hard in a system as well protected as Russia to have good intelligence on what's happening inside the head of the leader especially when so many of his own people do not know what is going on,"" Sir John Sawers, a former head of Britain's MI6, told the BBC. Mr Putin, intelligence officials say, is isolated in a bubble of his own making, which very little outside information penetrates, particularly any which might challenge what he thinks.   ""He is a victim of his own propaganda in the sense that he only listens to a certain number of people and blocks out everything else. This gives him a strange view of the world,"" says Adrian Furnham, a professor of psychology and co-author of a forthcoming book The Psychology of Spies and Spying. The risk is what is called ""group think"" in which everyone reinforces his view. ""If he's a victim of group think we need to know who the group is,"" says Prof Furnham. The circle of those Mr Putin talks to has never been large but when it came to the decision to invade Ukraine, it had narrowed to just a handful of people, Western intelligence officials believe, all of those ""true believers"" who share Mr Putin's mindset and obsessions.  The sense of how small his inner circle has become was emphasised when he publicly dressed down the head of his own Foreign Intelligence Service at the national security meeting just before the invasion - a move which seemed to humiliate the official. His speech hours later also revealed a man angry and obsessed with Ukraine and the West.  Those who have observed him say the Russian leader is driven by a desire to overcome the perceived humiliation of Russia in the 1990s along with a conviction that the West is determined to keep Russia down and drive him from power. One person who met Mr Putin remembers his obsession with watching videos of Libya's Col Gaddafi being killed after he was driven from power in 2011. When the director of the CIA, William Burns, was asked to assess Mr Putin's mental state, he said he had ""been stewing in a combustible combination of grievance and ambition for many years"" and described his views as having ""hardened"" and that he was ""far more insulated"" from other points of view.  Is the Russian president crazy? That is a question many in the West have asked. But few experts consider it helpful. One psychologist with expertise in the area said a mistake was to assume because we cannot understand a decision like invading Ukraine we frame the person who made it as ""mad"".  The CIA has a team which carries out ""leadership analysis"" on foreign decision makers, drawing on a tradition dating back to attempts to understand Hitler. They study background, relationships and health, drawing on secret intelligence. Another source are read-outs from the those who have had direct contact, such as other leaders. In 2014, Angela Merkel reportedly told President Obama that Mr Putin was living ""in another world"". President Macron meanwhile when he sat down with Mr Putin recently, was reported to have found the Russian leader ""more rigid, more isolated"" compared with previous encounters.  Did something change? Some speculate, without much evidence, about possible ill-health or the impact of medication. Others point to psychological factors such as a sense of his own time running out for him to fulfil what he sees as his destiny in protecting Russia or restoring its greatness. The Russian leader has visibly isolated himself from others during the Covid pandemic and this also may have had a psychological impact.  ""Putin is likely not mentally ill, nor he has changed, although he is in more of a hurry, and likely more isolated in recent years,"" says Ken Dekleva, a former US government physician and diplomat, and currently a senior fellow at the George HW Bush Foundation for US-China Relations. But a concern now is that reliable information is still not finding its way into Mr Putin's closed loop. His intelligence services may have been reluctant before the invasion to tell him anything he did not want to hear, offering rosy estimates of how an invasion would go and how Russian troops would be received before the war. And this week one Western official said Mr Putin may still not have the insight into how badly things are going for his own troops that Western intelligence has. That leads to concern about how he might react when confronted with a worsening situation for Russia. Mr Putin himself tells the story of chasing a rat when he was a boy. When he had driven it into a corner, the rat reacted by attacking him, forcing a young Vladimir to become the one who fled. The question Western policymakers are asking is what if Mr Putin feels cornered now?   ""The question really is whether or not he doubles down with greater brutality and escalates in terms of the weapon systems that he's prepared to use,"" said one western official. There have been concerns he could use chemical weapons or even a tactical nuclear weapon. ""The worry is that he does something unbelievably rash in a vicious press-the button way,"" says Adrian Furnham. Mr Putin himself may play up the sense that he is dangerous or even irrational - this is a well-known tactic (often called the ""madman"" theory) in which someone with access to nuclear weapons tries to get his adversary to back down by convincing them that he may well be crazy enough to use them despite the potential for everyone to perish.  For Western spies and policymakers understanding Mr Putin's intentions and mindset today could not be more important. Predicting his response is pivotal in working out how far they can push him without triggering a dangerous reaction. ""Putin's self concept does not allow for failure or weakness. He despises such things"" says Ken Dekleva. ""A cornered, weakened Putin is a more dangerous Putin. It's sometimes better to let the bear run out of the cage and back to the forest.""

Luton Town 1-1 Huddersfield Town: Championship play-off semi-final first leg ends in draw,"Fri, 13 May 2022 21:45:21 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61365570,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61365570?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The Championship play-off semi-final between Luton and Huddersfield is finely poised after the first leg ends in a draw.," Last updated on 13 May 202213 May 2022.From the section Championshipcomments516 The Championship play-off semi-final between Luton and Huddersfield is finely poised after the first leg ended in a draw at Kenilworth Road. Danel Sinani put Huddersfield ahead before Sonny Bradley equalised. Both sides had appeals for a penalty turned down in an exciting encounter. They will meet again in Monday's second leg, with the winner facing Nottingham Forest or Sheffield United at Wembley on Sunday, 29 May for a place in the Premier League.  Huddersfield should arguably have been awarded a spot-kick in the opening 10 seconds when Harry Toffolo was barged over by James Bree while trying to get to Ollie Turton's cross. The visitors then had to absorb a spell of pressure - but went ahead on the counter-attack after Luton were caught out by Toffolo's ball forward. Sinani, on loan from Norwich, capitalised by taking on Bradley and firing past keeper Matt Ingram at his near post. Skipper Bradley hauled Luton level on the half-hour mark by nudging home Kal Naismith's left-wing free-kick.  And Luton then had a penalty appeal of their own waved away by referee Robert Jones when Cameron Jerome burst through on goal and went down after tangling with Naby Sarr.  Huddersfield dominated possession as the Hatters tired in the second half, but both struggled to create clear-cut chances.  This season's play-off final will see the video assistant referee used in the Championship for the first time. Had it been operating in this game, the outcome might have been very different. As well as two possible penalties in the first half, there could also have been one in the second when Bradley grappled with Sarr in the area and seemed to drag him down. VAR might also have resulted in Luton's goal being disallowed as Harry Cornick, who was in an offside position, attempted to make contact with Naismith's delivery before Bradley directed the ball into the net from close range. A number of managers in the second tier have argued for the introduction of VAR in the division, and would no doubt point to this match as an example of why. Neither the Terriers nor Luton were rated among the promotion favourites at the start of season. Regardless of what happens in the second leg, both clubs have made a mockery of those odds.  Huddersfield finished the regular season in third place and had won six of their previous seven matches before the trip to Bedfordshire. They showed their quality while controlling possession in the second half against a determined Luton side, that has maintained a promotion challenge despite a limited budget and having been plagued by injury problems with Pelly-Ruddock Mpanzu, Gabriel Osho, Fred Onyedinma and talisman Elijah Adebayo among those sidelined. Nathan Jones' men will be no pushovers at the John Smith's Stadium, but Huddersfield will be pleased to begin their home leg on level terms. Huddersfield head coach Carlos Corberan told BBC Radio Leeds: ""If I assess the result, it was a fair result. If I analyse the performance, they felt more comfortable than us in the first half and we felt more comfortable than them in the second half.  ""In the second half we started to create more attacks and, even if we didn't create clear chances, it completely changed the feel of the game.  ""I feel that the players have learned a lot about not focusing on the atmosphere but focusing on the football.  ""We are now in exactly the same position as when we arrived in Luton. What we want to do on Monday is play another game of 90 or more minutes and the more we concentrate the more happiness we can give to our fans.  ""We need to be focused on the things that we do - how we attack and how we defend."" Luton manager Nathan Jones told BBC Three Counties Radio: ""I thought we were excellent first half, really were front-footed and controlled the game. ""We got hit with a counter-attack, that was probably it, but we had some real good chances and I was a little bit disappointed we didn't have a lead. ""Second half they came into it, controlled the play a little bit more in front of us - without really causing us massive problems - and I thought we defended our box fantastically well. (On Cameron Jerome penalty shout): ""It's nailed on, it's clear. Because they had half an appeal in the first seconds of the game, he [the referee] hasn't given it. They don't have that, he gives it. And it's a red card. ""It's last-ditch, he's brought him down. It's a real terrible decision."" Formation  3-1-4-2 Formation  3-4-3 Match ends, Luton Town 1, Huddersfield Town 1.

"Shoppers spent less for second month in a row, says BRC","Mon, 06 Jun 2022 23:03:37 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61709995,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61709995?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Shoppers are buying footwear and beauty items, but not furniture and electronics, new figures suggest.","Shoppers are spending less than they were a year ago, as the rising cost of living squeezes incomes, according to the body representing retailers. Sales, in-store and online, fell for the second month in a row in May, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said. Sales rose sharply last year after pandemic restrictions eased, but that ""spending bubble"" has now burst, the BRC's Helen Dickinson said. Total retail sales in May declined by 1.1% compared to May 2021. That was a sharper slowdown than in April, when BRC figures showed a fall of 0.3% compared to April 2021. Sales of clothing, footwear and accessories, including in fashion and beauty, rose, as people prepared for holidays and summer social occasions, including the Jubilee. But consumers were not buying bigger ticket items, such as furniture and electronics, the BRC said, as it published its latest monthly data, which it collects from the UK's medium and larger retailers. With inflation running at historic highs, what people are buying is costing them more. So a small drop in total sales masks a much larger drop in the volume of goods sold, once inflation is accounted for, the BRC added. ""It is clear the post-pandemic spending bubble has burst, with retailers facing tougher trading conditions, falling consumer confidence, and soaring inflation impacting consumers' spending power,"" said Ms Dickinson, the BRC's chief executive. The fall in May marks the second consecutive month of declining retail sales, as reported by the regular BRC-KPMG retail sales monitor.   It comes at a difficult time for retailers, who are also facing rising costs, especially of energy, transport and labour, which combined were ""forcing retailers to increase their prices"", Ms Dickinson added. The share of sales that take place online, as opposed to in physical stores, appeared to have stabilised, the BRC added. After rising sharply while pandemic restrictions were in place, online sales were ""settling"" at around 39%, compared to 30% pre-pandemic, the BRC said. ""Retailers will be hoping that a post-Jubilee and summer feel-good factor begins to improve confidence amongst some shoppers - as presently overall confidence levels are lower than sales may suggest,"" said Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG. Julie Abraham, chief executive of home entertainment retailer Richer Sounds, said: ""It's tough out there for everybody. ""We've seen a definite slowdown and we're having to work that much harder to give better value than ever,"" she told the BBC's Today programme.  She added that shoppers were ""far more savvy now and looking round for a good bargain"". ""So whereas sometimes it might have been more of an impulse purchase, nowadays they're looking very carefully at what they want to buy."" Over the four-day Jubilee bank holiday weekend, people did spend significantly more than the equivalent dates last year (which did not include a bank holiday) data from Barclaycard on Monday suggested. ""Despite wider concerns around the cost of living, the hospitality sector especially will be pleased by this welcome boost, having missed out on two years of unrestricted trading,"" said Barclaycard Payments chief executive Rob Cameron. Spending at restaurants rose 41.5%  over 2-5 June. Spending was up 74.2% at pubs, bars and night clubs, while spending on entertainment was up 67.3% and spending on public transport was up 38.8%, Barclaycard Payments said, based on credit and debit card transactions.

Disabled to get cost of living £150 from September,"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 00:59:46 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62636736,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62636736?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Up to six million people with extra costs will receive the additional cash sum, amid rising prices.","Up to six million disabled people will begin to receive Â£150 from 20 September to help with the rising cost of living. The government said within a couple of weeks of the roll-out date, the majority of eligible people will be sent the cash to their bank accounts. The payment is part of a package of measures introduced to help with the soaring costs of energy and food. However, critics say the support will not go far enough with household bills set to rise further this winter. The one-off Â£150 payment for disabled people is intended to help them with rising prices and the extra costs they face, such as for care and specialist equipment. Tom Marsland, policy manager at disability equality charity Scope, said the support ""isn't going to touch the sides in the face of energy bills predicted to reach more than Â£4,000 a year by January"". ""Many disabled people have no choice but to use more energy to charge vital equipment and keep warm,"" he said. ""Disabled people need much more financial support. This cannot wait - the government must double the support package now."" The typical gas and electricity bill has been forecast to hit Â£4,650 a year in January by consultancy Cornwall Insight. It has also estimated bills will go up to Â£3,554 a year from October from a current Â£1,971.  Research by Scope earlier this year found disabled people in England and Wales were twice as likely to live in poverty, more than twice as likely to live in a cold house they could not afford to heat, and three times more likely to be unable to afford food. Rising food costs pushed UK inflation to 10.1% in the 12 months to July, with prices continuing to rise at their fastest rate for more than 40 years. Meanwhile, economists have predicted rocketing energy prices could push inflation to as high as 18% next year, its highest rate in nearly 50 years.  Citizens Advice chief executive Dame Clare Moriarty welcome the payment but said: ""The support announced so far is rapidly being gobbled up by spiralling prices. More must be done to prevent desperate situations this winter, like people turning off vital equipment or wrapping themselves in blankets to keep warm."" Chloe Smith, Minister for Disabled People, Health and Work, said the government was providing the Â£150 because it understood disabled people could face additional costs. ""This Â£150 disability payment is on top of the Â£1,200 most low-income benefit claimants will also receive and alongside wider support targeted at disabled people, including help with transport and prescription costs,"" she said. ""We know it's a worrying time for some people and I'd urge them to check they are getting all the support on offer."" The government has previously said there would be no new policies before a new prime minister is in place. The new Conservative Party leader - and prime minister - is set to be announced on 5 September. As well as the disability cost-of-living payment, eight million low-income households have already begun to get support, with the first instalment of payments totalling Â£650 hitting bank accounts in July. From October, all UK households will see their energy bill reduced by Â£400 through monthly instalments over six months, with a reduction of Â£66 in October and November, and of Â£67 a month from December to March 2023.

"David Amess killing: Ali Harbi Ali told police 'I done it, I killed an MP'","Fri, 25 Mar 2022 15:43:14 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-60873662,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-60873662?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The Old Bailey hears the man accused of killing Sir David Amess told police it was a terrorist attack.,"This video can not be played Watch: Jurors were shown footage from a police interview where the suspect said  'I killed an MP'. Sir David Amess MP suspected his alleged killer was there for a sting in the moments before he was stabbed, a court has heard. Sir David, the MP for Southend West, died after he was stabbed more than 20 times during a constituency surgery in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, on 15 October. Ali Harbi Ali, 26, denies charges of murder and preparing acts of terrorism. Mr Ali told police ""he knew straight away something was up"", the trial heard. His police interviews, seven in total, were played to the jury. In one he told officers: ""Sat down with him. He was quick, but I think he knew straight away something was up. ""Well, it looked awkward 'cos I was holding my phone, ready to send off, like, a bunch of messages to let my family know what was up. ""Then he must've thought that it was a sting from the Labour Party, because he said to me, 'Oh, you must be very politically inclined. You're from the Labour Party, you're not recording me are you?' ""Because... Brass Eye, they did a thing on him, like, 14 years ago."" He claimed it was ""one of the strangest days...of my life"". In his first interview, hours after the attack he was asked if the stabbing was a terror attack.  To which he replied: ""I mean, I guess yeah I killed an MP and I done it yeah."" He then laughed and said he had worded the answer ""like a Little Britain episode"", the video showed. Mr Ali, who is thought to have been on the phone to his sister when he was arrested, said he was mostly worrying about his own family that day. ""The only reason I dropped the knife in front of the police officer was because my sister was on the phone crying her eyes out,"" he said. Throughout his interviews Mr Ali repeated that he was motivated by targeting MPs who had voted to carry out airstrikes in Syria, the court heard. Mr Ali also told police he had ""bottled"" previously planned attacks.  The court heard that he said he ""settled"" on Sir David after searching for 'MPs surgeries' on Twitter and seeing a post about a recent surgery by Sir David with contact information. ""He was the easiest. I settled on him"", he told police. Mr Ali said he first thought of attacking cabinet minister Michael Gove but decided against it when the secretary of state for communities and levelling up had split up with his wife Sarah Vine. He said he had also gone to London MP Mike Freer's surgery in Finchley. Talking about the attack on Sir David, he said: ""It's hard. You see a man alive, and then he's dead."" But a few moments later he told police: ""Obviously I killed someone yesterday, there's no doubt about that, but it still doesn't really feel like it.""

Jack Grealish answers critics in Wolves win as 'ominous' Man City roll on,"Sat, 17 Sep 2022 18:08:57 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62942730,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62942730?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"After Jack Grealish scores his first goal of the season in Man City's 3-0 win at Wolves, can anyone stop Pep Guardiola's side winning their third successive title?"," Last updated on 17 September 202217 September 2022.From the section Man City Jack Grealish could not have asked for a better response to his growing band of critics. After having both his performances for Manchester City and his place in the England squad called into question, Grealish responded with his first goal of the season, after just 55 seconds, against Wolves on Saturday. The forward was also at the centre of most of the visitors' attacking play as he helped Pep Guardiola's men cruise to a 3-0 victory. The result sees City head into the international break on top of the table after scoring 23 times in seven Premier League matches, while in Erling Haaland they have a striker in red-hot form with 14 goals in nine games in all competitions.  The campaign is not yet one fifth of the way through, but already questions are being asked about how anyone can stop City becoming only the fifth English club - after Huddersfield, Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United - to win three league titles in a row. ""It feels ominous for everyone, and almost feels like a one-horse race whatever the table tells you,"" former England defender Rio Ferdinand told BT Sport.  ""People have started to question Jack Grealish, today he answered the critics in a wonderful way."" Guardiola knows Grealish's British record £100m transfer from Aston Villa brings added pressure, yet has unconditional trust in him to deliver. Not much attention was paid to Grealish's slightly disappointing contribution to City's title-winning campaign last season, but there is more focus this time around. Guardiola went out of his way to talk up the 26-year-old before the Wolves game, saying he was ""delighted with his behaviour and everything"" even though City's Champions League comeback against Borussia Dortmund in midweek came after Grealish had left the field. The manager kept faith with Grealish and if it is regarded as a positive when opposition fans start to target you, the forward should be quite happy with his performance against at Molineux. A combination of his Villa connection, scoring inside a minute and being on the end of Nathan Collins' red-card challenge meant Grealish was singled out by the Wolves faithful throughout. He responded with understated, yet pointed, applause towards the South Bank when he was replaced by Cole Palmer 13 minutes from time, before thanking Guardiola for his support. ""It is nice when Pep defends me,"" he said. ""I probably have to thank him because he gave me the opportunity today after my performance on Wednesday, which probably wasn't the best."" Guardiola, meanwhile, just wants Grealish to be the player that persuaded him to pay big money to Villa last year. ""They don't have to say thank you,"" he said. ""I have confidence in all of them. I trust them unconditionally. ""Everybody has good moments and bad moments. The important thing is he thinks, 'I am Jack Grealish, I play like I am'. That is all I want for him."" Haaland has never scored in eight successive games. A goal against Manchester United next time out would see the 22-year-old reach that milestone. It has almost reached the point where it would be a shock if Haaland failed to find the net, so unerring has been his finishing. His latest effort was a rarity in that it was struck from outside the box - and one senses Guardiola will have been just as pleased with the Norwegian's contribution for City's third, which saw him have the awareness to roll the ball to Kevin de Bruyne, who crossed for Phil Foden to convert. Haaland now has 11 goals in seven league games. In the season that Mo Salah scored 34 to break the Premier League record for a 38-game campaign, he had reached four at the same point.  Only Fulham's Aleksander Mitrovic has reached half Haaland's tally so far this season. Even though Haaland will be absent later this year from the World Cup, which starts after the 2022 Ballon d'Or is awarded, former Manchester United defender Ferdinand can only see one winner next year if the Norwegian's form ultimately powers City to Champions League glory next June. ""He has the ability to break records because he is playing in a team that is absolutely dominating,"" Ferdinand said.  ""If Man City win the Champions League, there is no question he will win the Ballon d'Or. He is head and shoulders above anyone else.""

Benfica 1-3 Liverpool: Reds in control of Champions League quarter-final,"Tue, 05 Apr 2022 22:16:03 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60986738,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60986738?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Liverpool will take a two-goal lead into the Champions League quarter-final second leg after earning victory over Benfica in Lisbon.," Last updated on 5 April 20225 April 2022.From the section European Footballcomments1446 Liverpool will take a two-goal lead into the Champions League quarter-final second leg at Anfield but Jurgen Klopp says his side are ""not in dreamland"" after an important victory over Benfica in Lisbon.  Luis Diaz scored late on to put Klopp's side in control of the encounter but they could have been out of sight were it not for a number of fine saves from Benfica goalkeeper Odysseas Vlachodimos. Ibrahima Konate rose highest to head the visitors into the lead from a corner before Sadio Mane added a clinical second to dampen the mood at a lively Estadio da Luz in a dominant first half. The home fans ramped up the noise again shortly after the interval when Konate's mistake allowed sought-after striker Darwin Nunez to pull one back for the Portuguese outfit and make it a contest.  But the Premier League side will have a healthy advantage when they welcome Benfica in the second leg next Wednesday after Diaz added a late third with a composed finish after rounding Vlachodimos, who also denied Diogo Jota in the final moments. ""Coming here and winning an away game in the Champions League is tough. Obviously, Benfica fought for their lives,"" said Klopp. ""We could have scored in the last minute - the fourth one would be nice but we're not in dreamland here. ""It's half-time, we know much more about our opponent, they will go for it again. They won at Ajax, they ground out all the results out in the group stage that they needed, so we are aware of the quality and now we have a nice game in between and then we will be ready again for Benfica."" This was a near perfect start to a mammoth run of games for Liverpool that will define their season, with the return leg sandwiched between Sunday's game at Premier League leaders Manchester City and an FA Cup semi-final against Pep Guardiola's side six days later. The Reds are chasing a historic quadruple and have already won the Carabao Cup this year, despite Klopp saying four trophies is not a realistic target and insisting winning just one other competition this term would be ""outstanding"".  Their progress in Europe now looks set but it was not comfortable for the visitors until Diaz skipped round goalkeeper Vlachodimos to score his side's third with three minutes to go.  Diaz, jeered throughout because of his history with Benfica's domestic rivals Porto, was making his first Liverpool start in the competition but continued his seamless beginning to life with Klopp's side and proved a threat throughout.  He had earlier been denied by Vlachodimos, who stopped Mohamed Salah adding a third before the break as well as keeping out Jota late in the second half.  Liverpool were completely in control early on and were already threatening before Konate was left unmarked to head in Andrew Robertson's corner to score his first goal for the club. The visitors then ruthlessly punished a poor touch from former Tottenham and QPR midfielder Adel Taarabt, as Trent Alexander-Arnold angled a superb ball into Diaz and the forward cushioned a header into Mane's path to give him a simple finish.  Benfica, who upset an in-form Ajax side in the previous round, responded four minutes into the second half when Konate missed his kick from Rafa Silva's low cross and 22-year-old Uruguay forward Nunez showed why he is so in demand with a composed finish from close range for his fifth goal in the competition this season.  That gave the home side belief and, buoyed by the intense atmosphere their fans created, Benfica suddenly looked a different team as Everton tested Alisson from range and Nunez failed to convert after breaking in behind the defence, instead going down under pressure from Virgil van Dijk only to see his penalty appeal waved away. But it was Diaz who stole the show late on and Klopp's attention will now switch to a huge game against City in the race for the Premier League title.

Ukraine war: Russia's uncertain future a product of its past,"Wed, 02 Nov 2022 05:32:30 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-63471505,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-63471505?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Russia's invasion of Ukraine is making its future uncertain - but so too is its authoritarian past.,"In his St Petersburg apartment, university lecturer Denis Skopin shows me the document which has changed his life.  It's headed: ""Directive No.87/2D. Subject: Dismissal."" Until recently Denis was associate professor at the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Sciences of St Petersburg State University. But on 20 October the university sacked him for ""an immoral act incompatible with educational functions"". What was this so-called immoral act? Participation in an ""unsanctioned"" rally.  On 21 September Denis joined a street protest against the Kremlin's decision to draft Russians to fight in Ukraine. Earlier in the day, President Vladimir Putin had declared ""partial mobilisation"" across the country. During the demonstration Denis was arrested and spent 10 days in jail. ""Freedom of expression in Russia is in crisis,"" Denis tells me. ""All kinds of freedoms are in deep crisis."" ""After I was released from detention, I worked for three more weeks. The university sent me letters asking me to explain my absence. I replied that I'd been arrested for participation in a protest and put in detention. Then the Human Resources department called me and told me that I'd been sacked."" On his final day at work, Denis's students gathered outside the university to say goodbye.  In an impromptu speech (the video was posted online) he told them: ""What is an immoral act? Acting against your conscience and passively obeying someone else's orders. I acted according to my conscience. I am sure that the future of our country belongs to you."" The students broke into applause for their sacked teacher.  ""I love my students very much,"" Denis tells me. ""They are very smart and they understand very well what is happening now in Russia. Their [show of] approval was not for me personally. Rather, it was disapproval of what is happening now in Russia.  ""Many people in Russia don't dare to protest because they risk being punished for it. But many would like to. And, for these people, providing approval to those who do protest is a way of disagreeing with what is happening in Russia."" Denis Skopin's story highlights not just the pressure which opponents of the Kremlin's ""special military operation"" are coming under here. It also raises questions about Russia's future. ""Locked up with me in the detention centre there were IT specialists, scientists, doctors, teachers and students. Many of them are now abroad. Like my cell-mate, a young talented mathematician. ""About 25% of my immediate colleagues have already left Russia. They left after 24 February. Some of them left immediately, some left after mobilisation was declared. I think Russia is losing the best people now. The most educated, the most energetic, the most critically thinking people are leaving the country. In short, Russia is going in the wrong direction.""  An uncertain future is not solely the consequence of the present. It is also the product of Russia's past. Across town a small group of St Petersburg residents is standing beside a monument to the victims of Joseph Stalin's Great Terror of the 1930s.  The monument is made out of a large rock from the remote Solovetsky Islands, home to one of the most notorious forced labour camps of the Gulag. Solovki camp was set up to imprison political prisoners alongside other convicts.  People are queuing up at a microphone. They are taking it in turns to read out names of individuals who were arrested, condemned and executed in and around St Petersburg. ""Ekaterina Gansovna. Age: 46. Postal Worker.  Arrested: 9 December 1937. Shot: 18 January 1938. Yulia Stanislavovna. Age: 41. Pulp Factory Accounts Manager. Arrested: 27 September 1937. Shot: 21 December 1937."" It is thought that Soviet dictator Stalin had a million of his own citizens executed. Millions more lives were destroyed in his machine of terror which cranked out arrests, deportations and forced labour on a mass scale. Some of his successors, like Nikita Khrushchev and Mikhail Gorbachev, did denounce Stalin's crimes. And yet, in Vladimir Putin's Russia, Stalin has enjoyed something of a rehabilitation. The authorities today place less emphasis on the darker chapters of the Stalin years, while Stalin himself is often portrayed as a strongman who defeated Nazi Germany and turned the Soviet Union into a superpower. Putin's Kremlin seeks positives in the past - victories.  ""Unfortunately, our country didn't turn over this page properly. Stalin's repressions were not talked about enough or fully condemned. This is why the war in Ukraine is happening today,"" says pensioner Ludmila, who has come to lay flowers at the Solovki Stone.  ""Experience shows that remaining silent leads to bad things. We mustn't forget the bloody stains of our country's history."" Sacked university lecturer Denis Skopin has studied the Stalin years. He sees parallels between then and now. ""I just published a book in English about how people in Stalin's Russia removed from group photographs those who were declared 'enemy of the people'. Colleagues, friends or even close relatives had to remove all signs of them from photographs. They did it with scissors and with ink.  ""The faculty where I taught had a partnership with Bard College, an American liberal arts college. Last year Bard College was declared an 'undesirable organisation' in Russia. So, our faculty broke the partnership and the Bard College name was removed from the stands displayed in the corridors of our faculty using exactly black ink. In the same way as in Stalin's Russia."" If, as Denis claims, his students ""understand very well"" what is happening in Russia and Ukraine, that raises a question: if young Russians are not convinced by the Kremlin's arguments, how will the authorities persuade the public long-term to rally round the flag and back the president? Answer: by making sure young people ""understand"" events as the Kremlin does.  To help achieve that, a new patriotic lesson has been introduced into schools across Russia for all schoolchildren: ""Conversations About Important Things."" It is not part of the official curriculum, but it is the first lesson on a Monday morning and children are strongly encouraged to attend.  What ""important things"" are discussed there? Well, when President Putin played teacher in Kaliningrad in September, he told a group of children that the aim of Russia's offensive in Ukraine was to ""protect Russia"" and he described Ukraine as an ""anti-Russian enclave."" You can see which way the ""Conversation"" goes. ""This is forced education. To my mind this is as dangerous as it was in Soviet times when we had 'political information' lessons,"" says St Petersburg teacher Olga Milovidova, who retired last month. ""In those days we had to read the newspaper Pravda. And I remember we had to read books by [Soviet leader] Brezhnev as if they were masterpieces. We had to give only positives opinions. There was no critical discussion.  ""Education and patriotism mustn't be put together,"" believes Olga, who was a deputy school director. ""There are children who just believe. They open their eyes and they are ready to believe in anything. That is very dangerous.""

Eddie Butler: Former Wales rugby captain and legendary broadcaster dies aged 65,"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 16:34:16 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/62919134,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/62919134?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Former Wales rugby union captain and legendary broadcaster and commentator Eddie Butler has died at the age of 65.," Last updated on 15 September 202215 September 2022.From the section Welsh Rugby Former Wales rugby union captain and legendary broadcaster and commentator Eddie Butler has died at the age of 65. After rising to prominence with club side Pontypool, Butler played 16 times for Wales between 1980 and 1984, captaining the side on six occasions and scoring two tries. The number eight was called up to the British and Irish Lions squad that toured New Zealand in 1983. After retirement he became a respected rugby broadcaster. Butler died in his sleep on a charity trek in Peru. He was a pivotal part of the Pontypool side that was created by Ray Prosser and dominated Welsh club rugby in the late 1970s and early 1980s, captaining the side between 1982 and 1985. Butler had also played for Cambridge University from 1976-1978 while studying French and Spanish at Fitzwilliam College. Butler's first cap came in Wales' 18-9 Five Nations win against France in January, 1980. He retired from international rugby in 1985 aged 27 and having worked as a teacher in Cheltenham for three years, Butler then joined Radio Wales as a press and publicity officer in 1984. While still playing for his beloved Pontypool, Butler went on to work for a property development company. He started his newspaper journalism career with the Sunday Correspondent in 1988 before stints with Observer and the Guardian and returned to BBC Wales in 1990 after being brought back in by new head of sport Gareth Davies. Current BBC director-general Tim Davie paid tribute to ""a wonderful wordsmith"" who had shaped so much of the organisation's output. ""Everyone at the BBC is shocked and saddened by this very sad news,"" Davie said. ""Eddie was a brilliantly gifted commentator, writer and reporter whose passion for the game of rugby union shone through every broadcast. ""A wonderful wordsmith with a rich, iconic voice, he provided the definitive soundtrack to some of the greatest moments in rugby's history. He will be much missed by all of us and our thoughts are with his family at this sad time."" Director BBC Cymru Wales Rhuanedd Richards said: ""The world of rugby and broadcasting has lost one of its greats today. A giant in his sport as well as in stature, his knowledge of rugby - the ins and outs, foibles and triumphs - knew no bounds.  ""One of Eddie's greatest talents was his ability to capture and convey the meaning and the emotion of our great sporting moments with authenticity and a brilliant wit that took his audience on a journey.  ""He understood his audience, he understood Wales and he understood our passion for the game. Eddie's voice will be synonymous with so many great sporting memories, and it really is difficult to imagine these future moments in the world of rugby without him. ""I speak for all my colleagues at BBC Wales when I say that we'll miss him so much. Our hearts go out to his wife Sue and the children at this incredibly sad time and we send them our thoughts and deepest condolences."" Welsh Rugby Union chairman Rob Butcher said of Butler: ""He proudly represented his country as a player, was a mainstay in press boxes around the world long after he retired from the game and has been prolific in the way in which he has served Welsh rugby in both the written and spoken word over decades. ""Our thoughts and prayers go to his family, who we also know well and cherish, and his close friends and colleagues at this incredibly difficult time. ""He was a unique individual and the game in Wales owes him a debt of gratitude for his contributions both on and off the pitch."" Butler started his commentary career alongside the great Bill McLaren. After McLaren's retirement, Butler became the BBC rugby lead commentator where he formed a notable partnership with the likes of former England hooker Brian Moore and ex-Wales fly-half Jonathan Davies. Butler will be remembered for his brilliant prose that accompanied montages for major sporting and political events, with the final one marking the death of Queen Elizabeth II. He also commentated on Olympic sports and the Invictus Games, as well as lending his voice to stirring montages for the BBC's NFL highlights programmes. In 2010, Butler joined a host of former Wales captains who climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania to raise funds for Velindre Hospital, Cardiff's specialist cancer treatment centre. Butler presented history series on the BBC including Wales and the History of the World, Hidden Histories, Welsh Towns at War in 2014 and two series of Welsh Towns  in 2015. He was also an author after publishing three novels and two non-fiction books.  Away from rugby and broadcasting, Butler campaigned for Welsh independence in recent years. His passing prompted tributes and condolences from inside and outside rugby union.

Ukraine war: Chernobyl’s vodka producer remains defiant,"Sun, 27 Mar 2022 00:38:54 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-60879025,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-60879025?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"A company that produces Chernobyl’s ‘Atomik vodka’ releases new products, donating profits to Ukraine's refugees.","It started with ""Chernobyl moonshine"". Scientists who were studying crops grown in the Chernobyl exclusion zone decided to use some of their leftover grain to produce alcohol.  That experiment became a social enterprise that made and sold a spirit drink called, appropriately enough, Atomik.  The aim was to show that slightly radioactive fruit, grown in orchards in or near the contaminated exclusion zone that surrounds Chernobyl's nuclear power plant, could be distilled into a spirit that was no more radioactive than any other. Profits were channelled into communities that live in deprived areas close to the zone.      Now, as Russian troops occupy the land where that fruit is grown and harvested, this unusual company is making a defiant marketing move by releasing two more ""premium drinks"" and donating profits to help Ukraine's refugees.   While the future of an enterprise that makes a niche spirit might seem insignificant amid the ongoing crisis in Ukraine, it is an example of how decades of progress has been upended by war.  After 30 years of studying the exclusion zone, the scientists who set up the Atomik project enabled people on contaminated land to sell their own produce. It was a small but significant milestone in the recovery of a patch of Ukraine that was largely abandoned after the nuclear catastrophe in 1986.  ""Now, that whole region where we harvest our fruit for production is occupied by Russian forces,"" explained Kyrylo Korychenskyi, an environmental researcher and member of the Atomik team. Russian forces seized control of the now defunct Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the first few days of the invasion.  Military machinery kicking up radioactive dust in the usually carefully controlled zone caused a spike in radiation levels.  ""The information we're getting from the region is very bad,"" says Kyrylo. ""Russian forces go into the villages and  put their tanks in the middle of people's gardens."" In the heart of the exclusion zone, Ukrainian authorities have accused Russian forces of looting and destroying a new research laboratory designed to process and analyse radioactive samples and to monitor the zone.    Prof Jim Smith isÂ one of the founders of Atomik and a scientist at the University of Portsmouth. He has spent much of his career studying the exclusion zone and says that decades of progress are now being destroyed.   ""The communities who have been suffering for 35 years are now suffering even more,"" he told BBC News. ""We used to worry about the risk from radioactive strontium in [cities] that are now being bombed.""  The future of the Atomik project - and that of the people who live and grow fruit in their orchards near the exclusion zone - is uncertain.  If the war has ended by the time the next harvest season comes around, Kyrylo - who remains in his home in Kyiv with his wife and children -  says he hopes to keep going. He hopes to go back to his ""pre-war life"" and pick up the project where he left off.  ""I think people there will need money and help because the Chernobyl accident for this territory will no longer be the worst thing that happened there.""

Countryside crime rise linked to cost-of-living crisis,"Tue, 02 Aug 2022 01:32:12 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-62381648,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-62381648?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"The cost-of-living crisis has seen a rise in thefts of farm animals, vehicles and fuel, a report says.","Theft of farmers' livestock, vehicles and fuel is on the rise due to the UK's cost-of-living crisis, according to a new countryside crime report. Rural crime claims payouts between January and March were over 40% higher than in 2021, insurer NFU Mutual says. It warned rising food prices could see livestock thefts increase further and contaminated meat enter the food chain. The NFU wants the government to launch a national taskforce to deal with rural crime. David Exwood, the NFU's vice-president, said: ""Taking a joined-up approach and establishing a cross-governmental task force - including Defra, the Home Office, the Ministry of Justice, the National Police Chiefs Council and the Association of Police & Crime Commissioners - will be crucial if we are to prevent further impacts from crime on farm businesses, both financially and emotionally."" The NFU Mutual report warns that an increase in rustling - which saw an estimated Â£2.4m worth of farm animals stolen in 2021 - could see animals slaughtered in unhygienic conditions and sold on, threatening food security, animal welfare and people's health. Meanwhile, it said its claims data from the first half of this year indicate that fuel theft has more than doubled compared to the same period in 2021. Its survey found 49% of respondents felt fuel theft was now their greatest crime concern. The total cost of rural crime was estimated at Â£40.5m across the UK last year, an overall decrease on previous years and the second annual fall during the pandemic. Security measures, rural crime initiatives, quieter roads and community vigilance all played their part in suppressing countryside crime, the report found.  But Rebecca Davidson, NFU Mutual's rural affairs specialist, said that this year farm theft is ""quickly gathering momentum as criminals make up for time lost over the past two pandemic years"" and that was having an impact on farmers' mental health. ""Crime in the countryside causes high levels of anxiety and disruption, with many farmers and rural home owners feeling vulnerable due to their isolated location,"" she added.  ""The knowledge that determined thieves are scouring the countryside looking for targets, and returning to carry out night-time raids can lead to sleepless nights for people in remote areas.""

""Not long after I first started in this role, the BBC covered the 2009 Women's Euros in Finland. ""The truth is there was limited audience interest, the total reach for the tournament was just 2.5 million. ""The springboard was London 2012, when 70-odd thousand people crammed into Wembley to watch Team GB's women's team beat the mighty Brazil. ""It was a moment in time, when we knew the sport was ready to move to the next level. ""We invested heavily in our coverage and in 2019, 27 million tuned into the Women's World Cup in France on the BBC - the most watched sporting event of the year.

Madelaine McTernan named as new HRT tsar,"Fri, 29 Apr 2022 01:42:53 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-61255842,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-61255842?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,A UK-wide hormone-replacement therapy crisis has seen women turning to the black market.,"A new hormone replacement therapy (HRT) tsar has been appointed to help deal with UK supply issues. Madelaine McTernan has been part of the taskforce involved in the nationwide Covid vaccine rollout. There has been a shortage of some HRT products used by about a million women in the UK to treat menopause symptoms. The Department for Health and Social Care says Ms McTernan will use her knowledge from supplying vaccines to help address the shortage.  Women unable to obtain the medication have experienced symptoms including migraines, severe backpain and hot flushes.  And some have turned to the black market or private prescribers.  The DHSC says demand for HRT has risen by 38% in the past seven years, as access has been extended, but most of the 70 products available in the UK remain in good supply.  Ms McTernan and her new team will work with: Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""I understand how much women rely on HRT, which is why we will leave no stone unturned to help make sure women can get the HRT they need.  ""That is why I have taken decisive action to appoint Madelaine McTernan to head of the HRT Taskforce, who will use her excellent skills and expertise to build on the success of the Vaccine Taskforce to bolster supply of vital medicines to women across the country.""  One woman who began being prescribed HRT two years ago, Yasmin Darling, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme her treatment has only been in stock four times during that period. ""It means my migraines have increased and it affects my ability to sleep. That in turn has a knock-on effect on my ability to manage in general,"" she said. Pharmacist Reena Barai told the BBC managing drug shortages such as the current issues with HRT gel had become ""a factor of day-to-day life for pharmacists"". She said they would usually speak to the patient and try to arrange for an alternative to be prescribed. ""But by the time we get that prescription for an alternative, that alternative is no longer available as well so it's a bit of a vicious cycle for women at the moment,"" she said. ""Somebody needs to get a grip on the situation and co-ordinate the response."" Ms Barai suggested pharmacists could be given the ability to make minor changes to a prescription when medication is out of stock or rules over sharing medicines with other pharmacists could be relaxed to ease supply issues. Sleepless nights for women due to HRT shortage 'The thought of running out of HRT is terrifying' Relax law to ease HRT shortage, pharmacists say Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) - NHS China attacks 'bandit logic' of TikTok vote in US Israel says it plans Gaza 'humanitarian islands' Hundreds rescued from Philippines love scam centre How Malaysia Airlines came back from twin tragedies Rosenberg: Russia's stage-managed election The story of I Will Always Love You, 50 years on Zuma - the political wildcard in South Africa's poll 'Every day felt like an eternity' - freed Israeli hostage.

Spain eases Covid entry rules for UK travellers,"Sat, 21 May 2022 16:13:20 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-61535204,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-61535204?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,UK holidaymakers without a jab will be allowed entry with a negative test or proof of recovery.,"UK citizens who have not had a coronavirus jab can now travel to Spain by showing a negative PCR or antigen test on arrival. The Spanish government confirmed that non-vaccinated travellers from outside the EU can enter the country from Saturday. Fully vaccinated passengers will still need to show proof of vaccination. The UK removed all its remaining international Covid travel restrictions for entry on 18 March. This included passenger locator forms and tests for passengers who do not qualify as vaccinated. Other European countries followed suit, with Austria, Greece, Switzerland, Bulgaria, Croatia, Lithuania, Sweden, Serbia, Slovenia and Slovakia no longer having any Covid travel restrictions for visitors. Previously, heightened restrictions meant UK travellers were only allowed to enter Spain with vaccine certification or proof of recovery from the virus. As the latest wave of that strain dissipated, countries across the world loosened their Covid travel restrictions to welcome visitors again. And on Saturday, Spanish tourism minister Reyes Maroto said the ""new phase of the pandemic"" meant the country was able to relax the rules by equating non-EU travellers with those of the EU and Schengen-associated countries. ""This is excellent news, much awaited by the tourism sector,"" said Ms Maroto, adding: ""Spain is becoming one of the most desired destinations in the world."" We love Spain.  Mallorca, Marbella and Madrid are some of our holiday favourites.  In 2019, 18 million visitors from the UK arrived at Spanish airports - and the Spanish want to see the same numbers hitting their beaches again this year.  Demand is high for holiday destinations across Europe, with airlines and tour operators reporting surges for summer sun bookings almost everywhere. But Spain wants to retain its crown as Britain's favourite, and to do that it has to be open to everyone. That's why they've followed European holiday rivals and started allowing unvaccinated travellers - with a negative test - from today.  More holidaymakers means more euros arriving and that's good for the Spanish economy, where tourism is crucial.  From 21 May, all visitors entering Spain at air or sea borders, wherever they are travelling from, must provide one of the following three certificates: Spain accepts the UK's proof of Covid-19 vaccination record, either digitally, or as a printed download. PCR tests must be carried out in the 72 hours prior to departure to Spain or an antigen test in the 24 hours prior to departure. Proof of recovery certificates will be valid for 180 days from the date of the positive test. Children under the age of 12 are exempt from submitting any type of certificate. Julia Lo Bue-Said from the Advantage Travel Partnership, an independent travel agent group, said: ""This is very good news just ahead of the May half-term and peak season."" Describing it as ""extremely positive"" for holidaymakers and the travel industry, she added: ""However, it is disappointing that Spain has not gone further and removed the need for pre-arrival tests for unvaccinated travellers given the minimal benefit these tests have for public health.  ""Consumers want to travel with ease and if destinations prohibit this, then they will go elsewhere."" The Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) said the relaxation of the rules was great news as Spain is the most popular summer holiday destination for Britons. The travel industry trade body said: ""This summer is expected to be the busiest holiday season since the start of the pandemic, with 70% of families saying they have a holiday abroad booked this year."" Abta said that France, Italy, Greece and Portugal were also proving popular. While Greece has scrapped all Covid travel restrictions, the other three countries still require visitors to meet certain entry rules. Travellers either need proof of vaccination or to have taken a negative test before leaving the UK, while Italy and Portugal will also accept a Covid recovery certificate.

National Insurance: Will tax cut save me money?,"Thu, 22 Sep 2022 17:35:47 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-58436009,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-58436009?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The government has confirmed it will reverse the 1.25p increase in National Insurance.,"The government's reversal of the 1.25p in the pound rise in National Insurance (NI) has come into effect. It means many people will keep more of their pay. NI went up by 1.25p in the pound in April and went back to its previous level on 6 November.  For employees under pension age who earn less than Â£12,570 a year, the move will make no difference - because they don't pay NI.  Above that income level, the amount saved increases as earnings do. So higher earners stand to benefit more than people on lower incomes - although higher earners will still contribute more tax overall. The majority of businesses will also see a reduction in their NI bills. Each business will save an average of Â£9,600 each in 2023-24, according to the government. NI is a tax paid by employees, employers and the self-employed: NI contributes to the cost of benefits and the state pension. However, the government can borrow from the NI fund to help pay for other projects. NI raises a lot of money: Â£158bn last year according to HMRC. Whether you receive the full state pension depends on your NI record. Since 6 April, workers and employers have been paying an extra 1.25p in the pound.  The increase was part of the government's plan to fund the NHS and social care. It took the rate of NI to 13.25%. That meant the government went back on its 2019 election manifesto promise not to raise the tax. The NI increase was due to be replaced by a new Health and Social Care Levy - at a rate of 1.25% - in April 2023. But the government has now scrapped these plans, putting the NI rate back to 12%. That rate is paid by employees earning between Â£12,570 a year and just over Â£50,000 a year. Above that level, the rate has gone back down from 3.25% to 2.0%. The 1.25 percentage point increase in NI was supposed to raise Â£12bn a year. The government said the extra money would initially go towards easing pressure on the NHS.  Some would then be moved into the social care system. This mainly helps older people and people with high care needs, with tasks such as washing, dressing, eating and taking medication. The government has said that funding for health and social care services will be maintained at the same level as if the levy was in place. The funding for health and social care will now come from general taxation. The social care system is under pressure because of an ageing population and the effects of the pandemic. At the same time, it has also been hit by staff shortages and falling government spending. The government wants to ensure that people in England pay no more than Â£86,000 in care costs from October 2023 (not including accommodation and food). People with assets - such as a home, savings or investments - worth less than Â£20,000 will not have to pay for care out of those assets, but may still have to contribute from their income.  Those with assets worth between Â£20,000 and Â£100,000 may have their care costs subsidised. NI is a UK-wide tax.  Although the government decided to increase it in order to fund health and social care in England, the tax increase was also expected to raise extra money that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland could have chosen to spend on those services.

Which businesses will close and stay open on day of Queen's funeral?,"Wed, 14 Sep 2022 23:58:42 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62879563,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62879563?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Here's an at-a-glance guide to what will be open and closed on bank holiday Monday.,"Major shops and businesses across the UK shut their doors as a mark of respect for Queen Elizabeth II on the day of her funeral. King Charles III approved a bank holiday on Monday for the state funeral at Westminster Abbey. It was up to employers to decide whether to give staff the day off to observe the national day of mourning.  Many supermarkets and shop chains decided to close their doors, while others limited opening hours. Here's an at-a-glance guide to what was open and closed on the day of the Queen's funeral. It is thought more than a million people travelled to London for the state funeral so some convenience stores stayed open to give them access to food and drink. Department stores Harrods, Selfridges, John Lewis and House of Fraser have shut their doors, while some shopping centres were showing the funeral on big screens. Other shops that closed include: Holiday resort Center Parcs backtracked over a decision to ask guests to leave its sites on the day of the Queen's funeral. Guests have been allowed to stay but on-site facilities including restaurants are shut. Butlin's holiday resort stayed open on Monday, with some changes to arrival times. Some leisure operators decided to close their doors as a mark of respect. Some of the UK's largest pub and restaurant chains stayed open as a place for communities to come together to remember the Queen.  Other aspects of daily life have also been put on hold on the day of the state funeral.  Post offices were closed after Royal Mail announced its services would be suspended. Some of the UK's biggest strikes by postal workers and rail staff have also been put on hold. Major London train stations will be open and hundreds of extra train services have been scheduled with some running through the night. Pharmacies such as Lloyds and Well Pharmacy were shut all day. Some funerals that were scheduled for Monday have been postponed, in some cases at the request of the bereaved families and others because cemeteries and crematoria are closed for the day.  The government advised on its website that the additional bank holiday ""will allow individuals, businesses and other organisations to pay their respects to Her Majesty and commemorate Her reign, while marking the final day of the period of national mourning"". Although it says that some businesses ""may wish to consider closing or postponing events"", there is no statutory entitlement to time off for workers.

Italy 0-1 Belgium: Tine de Caigny hits winner to send Red Flames through,"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 21:54:09 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62198576,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62198576?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Belgium reach the quarter-finals of the European Women's Championship for the first time after overcoming Italy in a tense Group D finale at the Academy Stadium.," Last updated on 18 July 202218 July 2022.From the section Women's Euro 2022 Belgium reached the quarter-finals of the European Women's Championship for the first time after overcoming Italy in a tense Group D finale at the Academy Stadium. Tine de Caigny's low finish from the edge of the box secured runners-up spot to set up a last-eight tie with Sweden on Friday. Italy hit the bar through Cristiana Girelli soon after De Caigny's goal but they exit Euro 2022 after a second defeat in three games in England. Belgium, ranked 19 in the world, are appearing at only their second European Championship but can now prepare to face Sweden, who are ranked second in the world, at Leigh Sports Village.  The Red Flames were forced to endure some nervous moments in the closing stages, but advance after securing four points. ""We will enjoy this historic moment for Belgium football,"" said boss Ives Serneels. ""We did a great job. I'm also happy for all my players."" On a night of high tension at Manchester City's Academy Stadium, news that Iceland had fallen behind in the first minute to already-qualified France meant Italy, Belgium and Iceland were all locked on two points in the race for runners-up spot. With so much at stake, Italy and Belgium cancelled one another out in a cagey opening half. Italy, surprise quarter-finalists at the 2019 World Cup, went close inside the opening minute through Girelli before 19-year-old Hannah Eurlings fired narrowly over for Belgium. But the Red Flames, who had started the day third in the group behind France and Iceland, got the decisive goal when De Caigny cleverly drilled the ball low into the corner from the edge of the penalty area. That provoked an immediate response from Le Azzurre as Girelli rattled the bar before Belgium were denied a second when Tessa Wullaert also hit the woodwork in the closing moments. Belgium finished on four points, one more than third-placed Iceland and three more than Italy, who exit the tournament bottom of the group. ""I'm not disappointed with the girls,"" Italy boss Milena Bertolini said. ""We are a mid-range team. I don't think we deserved to lose but we were not calm enough. We had a number of opportunities but we were not able to take them."" This was the third and final game of Euro 2022 at the Academy Stadium, comfortably the smallest of the 10 venues at this tournament. Organisers have been accused of being unambitious for using the facility, which lies in the shadow of Manchester City's Etihad Stadium and has a capacity of 4,400 for this tournament. Earlier in the tournament, a bookmaker even poked fun by flying an inflatable arrow over the ground pointing towards the 55,000-capacity Etihad Stadium with 'Anyone seen a stadium big enough for a Euros game?' on it. But the Academy Stadium has rolled out the red carpet for Iceland's prime minister and president over the past couple of weeks - as well as Belgium men's boss Roberto Martinez. There was another lively atmosphere as Belgium edged through in front of 3,919 fans before celebrating wildly in front of their fans after the final whistle.

Bridgerton: How musical by TikTok stars became so controversial,"Fri, 12 Aug 2022 16:42:11 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-62523256,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-62523256?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,An unofficial Bridgerton musical cancels a planned London show after Netflix intervenes.,"A musical based on the Netflix hit Bridgerton was cancelled earlier this week, after the streaming giant threatened legal action over copyright. The Unofficial Bridgerton Musical, which started life as a series of viral TikTok videos, played to a sold-out audience in the US in July. Barlow and Bear, the creators of the musical, had hoped to bring the show to London's Royal Albert Hall next month. But it has been halted following a lawsuit from Netflix. Here's the story so far Bridgerton began life as a series of romance novels written by Julia Quinn, focusing on a widow and her eight offspring as they navigate high society in Regency England. Production company Shondaland, founded by veteran US TV producer Shonda Rhimes, adapted the books for Netflix. The first series was released on Christmas Day 2020 and became a huge lockdown success story, attracting large audiences and making stars of its cast.  A second series was swiftly commissioned and released earlier this year. A third and fourth series are in the works. Two fans of the show, Abigail Barlow and Emily Bear, both in their early 20s, began making their own social media content based on the series, under the name Barlow and Bear.  Their videos featured original songs, and invited users to add their own verses. Barlow would generally sing the lead vocals, while Bear would play the instruments and sing backing vocals. The songs were fun, playful and catchy and swiftly found an audience. By January 2021, their star was firmly on the rise. Less than a month after Bridgerton's release, Barlow was interviewed by BBC Radio 4's Today, explaining: ""I was just so inspired on a different level of someone else's creativity.  ""I thought, immediately, 'Well, this could be something that I could see on stage so I put it on TikTok just like I do [with] my pop songs that I write; and immediately people started getting invested and really wanted to hear more."" Some of the songs became so popular, the pair began recording fully orchestrated versions, eventually releasing an album last September. Their profile was growing rapidly, and Barlow and Bear spoke of their plans to turn their work into a full-blown musical in media interviews. Their songs were applauded by some cast members and even Quinn herself, who said: ""I know all about the musical and that is just blowing my mind... I'll be sort of humming in the shower and realise I've been humming one of the songs.""  The pair occasionally played down their sudden fame, with Barlow saying in an interview with NPR: ""We're just two girls, like, having fun writing music in our bedroom."" But while that may have been the case at the beginning, Barlow and Bear were quickly reaching a new level of success. They won a Grammy in April, taking home the award for best musical theatre album. Netflix initially did not stand in their way - essentially because it was, at this point, a light-hearted social media trend. It can be a bad PR move for big companies to clamp down on fairly harmless user-generated content, even if it does infringe on copyright.  If anything, they were encouraging. ""Netflix was very, very supportive,"" Barlow claimed in an interview last September. However, as their success grew, so did the concerns of the show's producers. The fact that they had not authorised the musical became increasingly problematic for Netflix and Shondaland. When Barlow and Bear attempted to monetise their success by staging their own musical in Washington DC and charging up to $149 (Â£123) per ticket, Netflix intervened. The streamer filed a lawsuit in the US in July, accusing Barlow and Bear of ""blatant infringement of intellectual property rights"" through the musical, which directly quotes from the series and lifts other material from it. ""Netflix supports fan-generated content, but Barlow and Bear have taken this many steps further, seeking to create multiple revenue streams for themselves without formal permission to utilise the Bridgerton IP [intellectual property],"" Netflix said in a statement last month. ""We've tried hard to work with Barlow and Bear, and they have refused to co-operate. The creators, cast, writers and crew have poured their hearts and souls into Bridgerton and we're taking action to protect their rights."" It added: ""What started as a fun celebration by Barlow and Bear on social media has turned into the blatant taking of intellectual property solely for Barlow and Bear's financial benefit."" The lawsuit contains several interesting details. For example, Netflix alleges that it tried to offer Barlow and Bear a licence that would have allowed them to legally perform their shows. ""Barlow and Bear refused,"" the lawsuit states, alleging the creators ""then doubled down on their infringement and resulting harm to Netflix"". But then, earlier this week, the Royal Albert Hall scrapped the planned 20 September performance of the musical and posted a statement online. ""Sadly, Barlow and Bear have cancelled their performance of The Unofficial Bridgerton Musical, Live in Concert at the Royal Albert Hall,"" it said Barlow and Bear have not yet publicly responded to the London show's cancellation or the lawsuit. BBC News have asked their representatives for comment.

Abortion pill: Why Japanese women will need their partner's consent to get a tablet,"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 23:53:06 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-62515356,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-62515356?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Japan has a history of being extremely slow to approve drugs related to women's reproductive health.,"While debate still rages in the US over the repeal of Roe v Wade, a much less noisy argument is unfolding in Japan over the legalisation of so-called medically induced abortions. In May, a senior health ministry official told parliament it was finally set to approve an abortion pill manufactured by British pharmaceutical company Linepharma International. But he also said that women will still need to ""gain the consent of their partner"" before the pills can be administered - a stipulation pro-choice campaigners have called patriarchal and outdated. Medical abortions, using pills rather than surgery, were made legal in France 34 years ago. Britain approved them in 1991, and the US in 2000. In many European countries this is now the most common form of terminating a pregnancy - pills account for more than 90% of abortions in Sweden, and around 70% in Scotland.  But Japan, a country with a poor record on gender equality, has a history of being extremely slow to approve drugs related to women's reproductive health.  Campaigners here joke that it took the country 30 years to approve the contraceptive or birth control pill, but just six months to approve the Viagra pill for male impotence. Both became available in 1999, but the latter came first.  And the contraceptive pill still comes with restrictions, making it expensive and difficult to use. It all goes back to the way abortion became legal in Japan.  It was actually one of the first countries in the world to pass an abortion law, back in 1948. But it was part of the Eugenics Protection Law - yes, it really was called that. It had nothing to do with giving women more control over their reproductive health. Rather, it was about preventing ""inferior"" births. Article 1 of the law says: ""To prevent birth of inferior descendants from the eugenics point of view and to protect the life and health of the mother as well."" The Eugenics Protection Law was renamed and updated in 1996, when it became the Maternal Health Protection Law. But many aspects of the old law remained. So, to this day, women who want an abortion must get written permission from their husband, partner, or in some cases their boyfriend. That is what happened to Ota Minami*.  She got pregnant after her boyfriend refused to wear a condom during sex. Condoms are still the primary form of birth control in Japan.  Ms Ota says he then refused to sign the document that would allow her to get an abortion.  ""It's strange that I had to ask him to use contraception,"" she says. ""And when he decided he didn't want to use a condom, I needed his permission to get an abortion.  ""The pregnancy happened to me and my body, but I need permission from someone else. It made me feel powerless. I couldn't make a decision about my own body and own future.""  Unlike the US, Japanese views on abortion are not driven by religious belief. Instead, they derive from a long history of patriarchy and deeply traditional views on the role of women and motherhood.    ""It goes very deep,"" Ms Ota says. ""When a woman becomes pregnant in Japan, she becomes a mother, no longer a woman. Once you are a mother you are supposed to give up everything for your child. It's supposed to be a wonderful thing. It's your body, but once you are pregnant, it's not your body anymore.""  Getting an abortion pill could also prove difficult and costly - estimated to be about $700 (Â£500) as it is likely to involve being admitted to a hospital or clinic - something the medical establishment in Japan says is necessary to protect women's health.  ""In Japan, after taking the abortion pill you will have to be kept in hospital so we can monitor the patient. It will take more time than a traditional surgical abortion,"" Dr Tsugio Maeda, deputy head of the Japan Gynaecological Association, told the BBC.  In many other countries, including the UK, it is now legal for women to administer the abortion pills themselves at home.  ""The maternal health protection act says an abortion must be carried out in a medical facility. So unfortunately under the current law we can't sell the abortion pill over the counter. It would be illegal,"" Dr Tsugio added.  Female sexual health campaigners say this has less to do with medical science and more to do with the medical establishment protecting a lucrative business.  ""I think a lot of decisions are made by men who are older and have bodies that will never carry a child,"" says Asuka Someya, a sexual health campaigner who runs her own NGO.  Ms Asuka says there is still huge resistance from the male dominated Japanese establishment to making abortion easier.  The argument goes that if you make it easier for women to have abortions, then the number of women choosing to do so will increase. So, they make it a difficult and expensive process. But, as evidence from other countries shows, this will only limit women's choices and increase their suffering - it will not lead to less unwanted pregnancies.  Ultimately, Ms Asuka says, the answer lies in better sex education and in Japanese women taking control of contraception, rather than relying on men to use condoms.  In Europe, the contraceptive pill is the most common form of birth control. In Japan, it is used by just 3% of women.  Ms Asuka adds: ""I want more policies to be made listening to the voices of young girls and women.""  *Some names have been changed to protect the identity of the contributors Japan: The worst developed country for mothers?

World Cup 2022: When is it taking place and why is Qatar hosting?,"Sun, 12 Jun 2022 23:17:53 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61635340,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61635340?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Football's World Cup finals take place in Qatar in November and December. Here's a guide to the tournament.," Last updated on 18 November 202218 November 2022.From the section Football Qatar is expecting 1.5 million football fans to visit during the World Cup finals. But the decision to host the tournament in the Gulf state has drawn widespread criticism. Homosexual acts are illegal in Qatar because they are considered immoral under Islamic Sharia law.  Punishments include fines, prison sentences of up to seven years - and even death by stoning.   Qatar's World Cup organisers say ""everyone is welcome"", and claim no one will be discriminated against.  However, Qatar 2022 chief executive Nasser al Khater says laws on homosexuality will not change and visitors should ""respect our culture"". A recent Human Rights Watch reportexternal-link says Qatari security forces continue to arrest citizens who are gay, lesbian, and transgender, sometimes forcing them to undergo conversion therapy. Qatar says the report contains false allegations. Fifa wrote to the 32 World Cup teams telling them ""now focus on the football"". It said football should not be ""dragged"" into ideological or political ""battles"". In response, 10 European football associations - including those of England and Wales - said ""human rights are universal and apply everywhere"". England captain Harry Kane and the captains of the other nine teams involved will wear ""One Love"" armbands to show support for LGBTQ+ people.  An estimated 30,000 workers from countries such as India, Bangladesh, Nepal and the Philippines built facilities for the World Cup finals - including new stadiums, hotels and roads. In February 2021, the Guardian said 6,500 workers had died in Qatar since it won its World Cup bid, using data supplied by embassies in Qatar. However, the Qatar government said the total was misleading as it counted many foreign workers who had lived in Qatar for a long time and had not worked on World Cup projects. Qatar's official records show that between 2014 and 2020, there were 37 deaths among labourers at World Cup stadium construction sites, only three of which were ""work-related"". However, the International Labour Organisation says this is an underestimate. It says Qatar doesn't count deaths from heart attacks and respiratory failure as work-related - even though these are often caused from working in high temperatures. It estimates that 50 foreign labourers died and more than 500 others were seriously injured in Qatar in 2021 alone, and another 37,600 suffered mild to moderate injuries. Qatar announced two days before the tournament that it will not allow sales of beer at World Cup stadiums. Now, alcohol will only be available in designated fan zones and the bars of luxury hotels. It will cost between £10 and £12 a can, or pint.  There will also be areas where drunken fans will have to go, to sober up.  Non-alcoholic beer will still be sold at the stadiums. In 2010, Qatar clinched the rights to the World Cup after winning a ballot of Fifa's 22 executive members, beating bids from the US, South Korea, Japan and Australia. It is the first Arab nation to host the tournament.  Qatar was accused of paying Fifa officials £3m ($3.7m) in bribes to secure their backing, but was cleared after a two-year investigation. At the time, Fifa's then-chairman, Sepp Blatter, supported the bid, but now says it was a ""mistake"" to award the World Cup to Qatar. There are eight stadiums, seven of which were built for the tournament. Some 100 new hotels have also been built, as well as a new metro system, new roads, and an extension to Hamad airport. Qatar has also built an entire new city around the Lusail stadium, in which the final match will be played.  During the months of November and December, the temperature in Qatar is usually around 25C (77F). Had the World Cup finals been held in June and July, as they usually are, matches would have been played in temperatures exceeding 40C, and possibly reaching 50C. Qatar initially proposed hosting the finals during the summer in air-conditioned, enclosed stadiums, but the plan was rejected. "
Which trains will run in Scotland during the strike?,"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 06:19:58 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-61826685,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-61826685?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The operator will cancel 90% of its trains during three days of strike action by the RMT this week.,"ScotRail will have to again cancel the vast majority of trains during the latest strike action by the RMT union this weekend. The strike by about 40,000 Network Rail staff is part of a dispute over pay, working conditions and redundancies that will badly affect services across Scotland, England and Wales as well as the London Underground. The latest 24-hour RMT strike is being held on Saturday, and follows one on Thursday. Passengers have been warned that disruption will not be confined to the day of the strike, with services also being impacted on Friday night and Sunday morning. ScotRail will run a very limited service on 11 routes in the central belt, Fife, and the Scottish Borders, with no trains anywhere else on the strike day.  Trains will only run from 07:30 on the routes that will remain open, with the last trains departing well before 18:30. The routes are:  You can check this page for further information. Trains in England and Wales will also be badly affected, including services between London and Scotland on both the East and West Coast mainlines.  Passengers have been urged to only travel if it is necessary, and anyone who does so should plan ahead and expect disruption.  There will not be any replacement buses or taxis throughout the period of industrial action.  Anyone who has bought a ticket they are unable to use will be able to claim a full refund.  This dispute does not involve ScotRail staff, but it relies on Network Rail workers to operate signal boxes and maintain the track across the country.  Signal boxes are crucial to the rail network because they control train movements and allow the railway to operate safely.  Network Rail has said the strike means it will only be able to open signal boxes on a few routes, so it would not be safe for trains to run anywhere else.  It will also take time for signal boxes across the country to reopen the day after each strike, which is likely to cause further disruption.  Large signalling centres in central Scotland are expected to be able to operate from 07:15, but it could be later in the day before manual signal boxes elsewhere in the country open again.  Here are updated lists of trains that will be running on Friday 19 August and  Sunday 21 August.  The RMT is in dispute with the UK government and rail companies including Network Rail about pay, job cuts and changes to terms and conditions. They say salaries should increase to reflect the rising cost of living. Network Rail says its latest offer is worth more than 5%, but this depends on workers accepting ""modernising reforms"".  However, the RMT argues that this is a ""paltry sum"" and represents a real terms pay cut. The RMT says another issue is plans by Network Rail to cut 2,500 maintenance jobs, as the company tries to save Â£2bn over the next two years. The union insists those jobs are ""safety critical"". Network Rail says there would be no more than 2,000 job losses - and that all redundancies can be voluntary. It says it would not consider any changes that would make the railways less safe, but stresses modernisation is needed. The industrial action is also being supported by members of the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association and Unite who work for Network Rail and some other rail companies.  It is not related to a separate dispute between the RMT and ScotRail which saw the union threatening strike action after its members - including ticket examiners, conductors and station staff - rejected a 5% pay rise earlier this month.

Bodo/Glimt 0-1 Arsenal: Bukayo Saka scores as Gunners near Europa League progression,"Thu, 13 Oct 2022 18:50:04 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63236405,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63236405?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Arsenal take a big step towards qualifying for the Europa League knockout stage with a slender win at Bodo/Glimt.," Last updated on 13 October 202213 October 2022.From the section European Footballcomments446 Arsenal took a big step towards qualifying for the Europa League knockout stage with a slender win at Bodo/Glimt. The winner came after Bukayo Saka combined with impressive midfielder Albert Sambi Lokonga and his toe-poked effort hit a defender before ricocheting back off his chin and past the helpless goalkeeper. Bodo/Glimt came into the game with a 14-game winning streak at home in Europe and they were spurred on by a boisterous crowd, but they were guilty of missing a number of clear-cut opportunities. Amahl Pellegrino skewed wide when through on goal in the first half, while Runar Espejord placed over when eight yards out in the second. It was far from vintage Arsenal on the artificial pitch in Norway, as shown by the fact they had to bring on Granit Xhaka and Gabriel Martinelli after an hour, but the result, combined with the fact he was able to rest key striker Gabriel Jesus and defender Gabriel, will delight manager Mikel Arteta.  The win leaves Arsenal five points clear of third-placed Bodo/Glimt, who have played a game more because the Gunners' fixture against PSV Eindhoven last month was postponed owing to policing issues following the death of Queen Elizabeth II.  The rearranged match with second-placed PSV takes place next Thursday, when a win will guarantee Arsenal's progression.  Saka was mightily impressive in the Gunners' 3-2 win over Liverpool in the Premier League on Sunday and you could see the confidence flooding out of him in Norway. He was lively from the start, getting in behind the Bodo/Glimt defence and firing across the six-yard box after two minutes but neither Eddie Nketiah nor Reiss Nelson gambled. The 21-year-old continued to persist, though, and it was his driving run, rather than the relatively slow and patient build-up that had gone before, that cut open the hosts' defence.  He got a huge slice of fortune with the deflection, but it was reward for his endeavour and once again highlighted his importance to this ever-improving Arsenal side.  There were five changes from last week's 3-0 home win over the same opposition, and seven from the team that beat Liverpool, but the result and resolve they showed to keep Bodo/Glimt out in the second half is another example of the more gritty and disciplined side that is being moulded by Arteta.  Rob Holding made a key interception in the first half, while Lokonga completed 97% of his passes and made more interceptions than any other Gunners player.  With a potential Premier League title challenge on the cards, Arteta will be keen to get top spot wrapped up as early as possible so he can rotate players and avoid the extra play-off round in February.

Halifax Acapulco club sells off sticky carpet,"Wed, 09 Mar 2022 11:51:32 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-60673798,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-60673798?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"The boss of Halifax's Acapulco club says its ""crazy"" floor covering holds years of memories.","A nightclub renowned for its sticky carpet is selling off souvenir chunks of its storied adhesive floor covering. Halifax's Acapulco has been a fixture in the Yorkshire town since 1961 and punters have walked its distinctive, swirly patterned tapestry for 20 years. Owner Simon Jackson said the sale idea came from a man celebrating a birthday with his mum and grandmother who had been club regulars in their youth. The proceeds will be donated to a local Street Angels group. Mr Jackson said the Acca - as the club is affectionately known - was a source of memories for generations of people in Halifax. ""We got to thinking how many people have met here and had first kisses, birthdays whatever here, that's when we got the idea,"" he said. ""Just think how many people have walked on its famous, crazy pattern."" Mr Jackson said the parents of the birthday boy who inspired the scheme had actually met on the Acca's dancefloor. He said he had even received an email from someone who spread a little of their grandmother's ashes on its carpet a few years ago.  The proposal to sell squares of the carpet - at Â£5 each or Â£50 for a more sanitary framed version - started as a joke, according to the owner, but had ""snowballed"" as people expressed genuine interest. Mr Jackson, 55, first worked at the club in the 1980s, became its owner in 1995 and still works as a DJ there. The original carpet was made in Halifax and was due to be replaced several years ago, but a fire at the club followed by Covid restrictions had pushed the work back. ""We are one of a few clubs that have survived lockdown and with being the oldest Acapulco in the country, and family-owned, we feel more responsible to keep it going"", Mr Jackson said. Work to replace the carpet has already started, and is expected to take about two weeks. ""The building is not the prettiest of places but it holds so many memories, it's not a trendy place just somewhere to party and forget your worries,"" he said.

Who is Kwasi Kwarteng? New UK chancellor likes a challenge,"Tue, 06 Sep 2022 18:17:09 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62796213,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62796213?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The new UK Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng is a past winner of University Challenge - and a key ally of Liz Truss.,"Kwasi Kwarteng has been sacked as chancellor and replaced by Jeremy Hunt after his mini-budget resulted in financial turbulence and a revolt from Tory MPs. He has become Britain's second shortest-serving chancellor, lasting just 38 days in the role. The long-time ally of Prime Minister Liz Truss, seen as her political soulmate, was appointed to the role on 6 September. Speaking before Mr Kwarteng became chancellor, one friend told the Times that he and Ms Truss were a bit like ""Batman and Robin"", adding: ""They are both slight social misfits, amiable geeks, and have strong views which are in tune with each other."" He took over at Number 11 Downing Street at a critical time for the UK economy, with millions looking to him for help with soaring winter energy bills.  An Old Etonian who became the first black Conservative cabinet minister in 2021, he read classics and history at Trinity College, Cambridge, and has a PhD in economic history. He is also a past winner of notoriously tough BBC quiz show University Challenge. Age: 47 Place of birth: East London Education: Trinity College, Cambridge and Harvard University Family: Married to solicitor Harriet Edwards with one daughter Parliamentary constituency: Spelthorne (Surrey) Mr Kwarteng's parents came to the UK from Ghana as students in the 1960s. He was born in East London in 1975, the same year as Ms Truss. His economist father and barrister mother gave him a traditional Ashanti first name, meaning ""born on Sunday"", when he was actually born on a Monday. He told the BBC's Political Thinking with Nick Robinson podcast his parents stayed silent on the matter when he jokingly pulled them up on it. The Church was a strong part of his mother's life and she was a lifelong Conservative voter.  He was just three years old when Margaret Thatcher came to power, and she would remain prime minister until his GCSE year. He has said in the past that his mother deeply admired Mrs Thatcher as someone ""who wanted to rely on their own efforts"" and has described himself as a ""pragmatic Thatcherite"". He attended the exclusive private school Eton College after winning a scholarship there, and went on to graduate with a double first from Cambridge University in classics and history. One well-known anecdote about the young Kwasi Kwarteng harks back to his admissions interview for Trinity College. The self-confident 17-year-old told the tutor, who had arrived late and hadn't conducted many of these interviews before: ""Don't worry, sir - I'm sure you'll do very well."" He was part of the Cambridge team which won University Challenge in 1995, although he generated headlines for uttering a swearword after he buzzed in and forgot the answer to a question. He has since questioned how much being good at quizzes ""relates to anything in what people call 'real life'"".  He attended Harvard University in the United States on a Kennedy Scholarship, before returning to the University of Cambridge to complete a PhD in economic history in 2000.  During his second stint at the university, Tristram Hunt, the former Labour MP and now head of the V&A Museum, joked that then roommate Mr Kwarteng was ""quite ungovernable and dishevelled"". He worked as a columnist for the Daily Telegraph and a financial analyst at banks including JP Morgan in the City of London and got involved in Conservative politics as chairman of the Bow Group think tank.  He has remarked that ""politics was always something I was drawn to"", and he made his first attempt to become an MP in 2005. He stood as the Conservative candidate for Brent East at the general election, but came third. There was also an unsuccessful run for the London Assembly in 2008.  However, he became part of the ""class of 2010"", a cohort of politicians entering Westminster for the first time that year. He was elected as MP for Spelthorne in Surrey and entered Parliament the same time as future colleagues Ms Truss, Priti Patel and Sajid Javid. His maiden speech in the House of Commons came with some comments he described as ""controversial"", when he used the opportunity to criticise the former Labour government led by Gordon Brown and how it tackled the 2008 financial crisis. ""They have not once accepted any blame for what happened and they seem to think that we can just sail on as before,"" he said, also setting out the view that ""wealth creation is the most important element in getting us out of this recession"". Although Mr Kwarteng was tipped to become the Conservatives' first black cabinet member as early as 2006, he spent eight years as a constituency MP before he became a minister.  He backed Leave in the 2016 Brexit referendum, and in 2017 became a ministerial aide to the then Chancellor Philip Hammond, before becoming a junior minister in the Department for Exiting the European Union. Mr Kwarteng also co-authored the book Britannia Unchained with several Tory MPs, including Ms Truss. In the 2012 text, they claimed: ""Once they enter the workplace, the British are among the worst idlers in the world."" He has since distanced himself from this view.   Mr Kwarteng has used his spare time to write several books and pamphlets on topics from Mrs Thatcher's final six months in office to the British Empire and its legacy.  He has argued that ""the debate around Black Lives Matter and imperialism or colonialism has a cartoon-like view of history"", and has said he thinks that view is true on both sides of the issue. Mr Kwarteng was a supporter of Boris Johnson who put him on the ministerial fast-track as energy minister in 2019. He worked there for more than a year before becoming business secretary 18 months later. The ascent has been described as a ""reward"" for his backing of Mr Johnson during the race for party leadership.  The realities of the pandemic and the soaring cost of energy, however, meant that his views on state intervention in industry moderated.  ""There's nothing [better] to convert someone from being a radical free marketeer to seeing the virtues of government action than making them an energy minister,"" he said at a 2019 Conservative party conference event. That same year, he married solicitor Harriet Edwards, having previously dated former Home Secretary Amber Rudd.  His political partnership with Ms Truss, a fellow member of the 2010 intake of MPs, paid dividends when she asked her close ally to serve as chancellor. But the mini-budget he unveiled on 23 September spooked financial markets and prompted a drop in the value of the pound. Amid warnings from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Bank of England stepped in to buy government bonds in a bid to stabilise their value. The chancellor said he had listened to criticism - including from within his party - and there was a U-turn on a plan to abolish the 45p rate of income tax for top earners. But market turbulence continued, causing speculation that the government would announce a further reversal on its tax-cutting plans. The day before his ejection from Number 11 Downing Street, Mr Kwarteng said ""our position hasn't changed"" - and that he would ""absolutely"" still be in his job a month later.

Ellen White suffered punctured lung during acupuncture,"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 18:59:32 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62692632,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62692632?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,England striker Ellen White says a punctured lung she suffered last year while receiving acupuncture treatment accelerated her retirement.," Last updated on 26 August 202226 August 2022.From the section Women's Football England's record goalscorer Ellen White has revealed she suffered a punctured lung last year while receiving acupuncture treatment, which accelerated her decision to retire. White, 33, said she was still coming to terms with the ""traumatic"" injury. Manchester City had sourced a specialist outside the club to provide her with acupuncture to treat her back problem because of a high number of injuries in the squad at the time. She announced her retirement this week. White helped England win Euro 2022 in July and told BBC Sport she knew going into the tournament that she was going to retire from football afterwards.  ""If you'd said to me two or three years ago that you're going to retire, I would have said 'absolutely not', but I've got to a time in my career,"" she said. ""I had a challenging time last year - coming back from the Olympics, I basically punctured my lung, and it was a lot for me to have to go through and a big reason that accelerated my want to retire."" The injury happened when she had returned to her club with a back spasm last summer, having helped Great Britain reach the Olympic football quarter-finals. It is understood that City arranged for an external specialist to perform the acupuncture as there was an unusually high number of injuries across their squad following the Olympics, and that it is common practice at the club for that to happen. Acupuncture is a treatment derived from ancient Chinese medicine, where fine needles are inserted at certain points in the body to stimulate nerves. ""It punctured my lung which isn't something that happens normally, obviously,"" she said. ""It was a really traumatic time for me and something that I'm still figuring out now, still working through."" The injury left White, who scored 52 goals in 113 appearances for England, short of breath and unable to do any exercise. ""I had to wait for the lung to basically inflate again. I had a needle put into my chest to drag all the air out then hopefully the lung would inflate again - which it has.  ""At the time, I think for me, I just got into a zone of: 'I need to get back playing. We've got these games - I want to be back playing for my club; I want to be back playing for England.'""  Her club announced last August that she was set for a brief spell on the sidelines to receive treatment for a ""medical issue"".  Just over two weeks later, she was back playing and scoring for England against North Macedonia. ""I went very tunnel vision,"" she said. ""It wasn't until a good two or three months later, it just hit me like a train, what actually happened and how traumatic it was."" Despite her quick return to goalscoring form, which included becoming the Lionesses record goalscorer in November, the striker says she is still affected by the injury and suffers ""phantom pain"" where it feels like it is happening again. ""It's important for me now to tell my story, and say it was a big factor in my year and leading up to the decision of wanting to retire. Obviously there are other factors that come into that as well.  ""I don't want it to happen to anybody else again is my main thing. I don't want to walk away from the sport having not told it and not say that I want things in place for it not to happen to anyone else.""

Energy price cap: Questions firms need answers to,"Fri, 09 Sep 2022 21:32:38 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62850189,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62850189?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Firms will get energy price support for six months, but they say many questions remain unanswered.","Business groups have welcomed the government's plan to ease the impact of soaring energy bills but have warned that uncertainty remains. On Thursday, Liz Truss unveiled a plan to support both households and businesses with their energy bills. Firms will see prices capped for six months and ""vulnerable sectors"" may get further support. But some firms still have concerns, including about how much support they will get, and for how long. Vicky Foster, who owns Studio 58 hairdressers in Penwortham, Preston, said her energy bills were going to jump from Â£277 per month to Â£890 under a new contract she'd had to negotiate. Her hairdressing business has to keep the heating on during the cold winter months. ""I've got customers sat with wet hair - they have to be kept warm,"" she said. Vicky said she'd had a ""hugely stressful couple of months"" trying to sort out her energy bills when her contract came up for renewal. She ended up taking a risk on a three year contract, as that seemed to be the most cost effective option. ""That's what's made me feel sick,"" she said. ""I've been waking up at night. I've not been this stressed in donkey's years."" If energy prices go back down Vicky is worried she will be stuck with an unaffordable energy bill. And she has already had to pass the extra costs onto her customers. ""We've had to put the prices up,"" she said. ""It remains to be seen whether people will pay it."" With the continuing squeeze on the cost of living, and people trying to make savings, ""will they economise on hairdos?"" she said. Vicky added that it wasn't clear yet whether businesses that have fixed their energy contracts will still get government help, and which businesses would be defined as ""vulnerable"". Rob Bowman, whose Refrigeration Specialists business puts together refrigeration services for industrial and commercial clients, said his energy costs had quadrupled in the past three years. He said the government support will slow down the rise in energy bills, but they were still going to rise. ""It's going to get worse rather than better,"" he said. ""It will be even worse in six months time. When that help is taken away the economy is just going to absolutely crumble."" ""I feel we're on a big chute heading down into a big pit,"" Rob added. ""Small businesses need to stand up and say loud and clear that we are in trouble."" The scheme to limit energy costs for businesses will be in place for six months, with a review in three months to see where support should be most targeted. Households will get two years of support. Businesses' bills have not had a price cap in the same way households have. Some firms had warned that their energy bills could rise by up to 500% without a plan to ease the pressures.  And while the support for businesses could be extended, it is not certain for which industries, making cost planning difficult. Arjan Geveke, director at the Energy Intensive Users Group (EIUG), which represents industries such as steel, chemicals and glass manufacturers, said he thought the six month period was based on the assumption that wholesale energy prices will fall back.  ""But this might not necessarily be the case,"" he said. Wholesale energy prices have been soaring as economies recover from Covid, fuelled further by the war in Ukraine which saw Russia severely restrict its supplies of gas to Europe. That's pushed up the price of gas, including in the UK. Meanwhile, the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) has warned that firms could be in trouble once the support stops. Chairman Martin McTague said: ""This must not result in a cliff-edge after six months, with the withdrawal of support to all but 'vulnerable' targeted industries, sectors or types of business."" Announcing her plan to MPs, Ms Truss said that after the initial six months, ""we will provide further support to vulnerable sectors, such as hospitality, including our local pubs"". She added that she, together with Business Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg, would work with business to review where the additional support should be targeted. But it is not clear what defines a ""vulnerable"" company.  While there has been a focus on pubs, energy intensive industries have also called on the government to include them in a review. Mr Geveke warned that the industries he represents would be put at a ""significant competitive disadvantage internationally"" if energy bills increased more. The FSB said there needs to be a fair assessment of which firms should qualify for additional support at the three-month review. ""There's talk of continuing to support vulnerable sectors or individual small businesses,"" a spokesman told the BBC. ""Well, an awful lot of them are vulnerable. In fact, all of them, if they're using significant amounts of electricity."" Some businesses, such as Vicky Foster's, have already agreed fixed price contracts at high prices in recent months.  At this stage, it is unclear what happens to them, although the BBC understands that the Department for Business will provide more details next week. The government has said the support for businesses will be ""equivalent"" to the deal being offered to domestic customers, but it hasn't given any further details at this point. ""There are still lots of detailed conversations going on with the government,"" said Keith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power.  ""Some of the details are still being worked through, and there's lots more complexity in the business market because of the different types of companies, the different sectors they operate in, and the different contracts they're on. ""But I think very soon we will be able to see the detail of that and we'll be able to communicate that to each of the companies involved."" The FSB said more information is needed. ""There are questions about what happens to people who have recently gone onto a fixed tariff that's pretty high in price. Would they be able to benefit from this cap or would they be excluded from it?"", an FSB spokesman said. ""It sounds like a really big game changing moment to support small businesses who have been struggling with energy prices. But we do need more detail.""

Canada reach World Cup: John Herdman - the English manager behind landmark qualification,"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 11:28:11 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60144426,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60144426?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Englishman John Herdman will lead Canada to the World Cup later this year after helping transform the nation's football fortunes.," Last updated on 28 March 202228 March 2022.From the section World Cup In England, memories of the 1986 World Cup centre around Diego Maradona, the 'Hand of God' and the wonder goal he scored for Argentina in that quarter-final win en route to lifting the trophy. Canadian memories of that tournament in Mexico are somewhat different. Three games, no points, no goals. At least they got there, though.  Until now, 1986 remained the only time Canada had qualified for a World Cup. That all changed on Sunday, when a 4-0 win over Jamaica booked Canada's place at the 2022 Fifa World Cup. And it promises to be a golden period for them, since it is anticipated - but not yet confirmed - that their status as co-hosts for the 2026 tournament will bring automatic qualification. This year's landmark achievement has come under the guidance of John Herdman, the English coach who led the Canadian women's team to successive bronze medal Olympic Games finishes in 2012 and 2016. It is unlikely he will become the first English manager to win the World Cup since Sir Alf Ramsey in 1966, but Canada are upwardly mobile and they will pose a threat in Qatar. Alphonso Davies is the poster boy for Canadian football, though Herdman and his team have had to complete qualification without the Bayern Munich defender after he was diagnosed with a heart condition in January. He is on the road to recovery and will hope to feature at the World Cup, along with the likes of Lille forward Jonathan David and Besiktas frontman Cyle Larin. Those players are evidence of the growing strength of youth development in Canada - and the wider interest in football in a country that has traditionally focused on more established sports. ""Canada is a hockey nation, but football is the highest participation sport,"" said Herdman, speaking to BBC Sport in January. ""All the kids play football, that is the reality. The country has a very diverse demographic. We have a lot of immigrants, including myself, whose first love is football. ""But they have not had a national team to rally around. The women's team has been uber successful but the men's team hasn't broken that threshold.  ""It is a sleeping giant. It is ready to put itself into the sporting consciousness of the genuine Canadian sports fan."" Images of Canada celebrating in the snow after their win over Mexico in Edmonton in November were memorable. Herdman and his staff had already worked out that Concacaf's gruelling qualification schedule was not set up to help his team. The conditions play a big factor, with Canada often having to face opponents whose home climate is markedly different to the one Canada's players are used to. ""In Haiti, in June, it was 37 degrees,"" added Herdman. ""People's boots were melting on the rubber on the plastic turf.  ""There are moments in those games where the opportunity to check out is there. The ability to say 'OK, we have an excuse, it is too hot'. The brain is always playing with that.  ""It was time for our opponents to get that feeling."" So the Mexico game was played in Edmonton, where the temperature during the match was recorded at -9C and the snow fell beforehand - lots of it. ""We could have played in a more hospitable climate, maybe even in a closed, indoor stadium, but we were pretty clear this was a new Canada,"" said Herdman. ""It is a very resilient nation that has grown up having to play on plastic fields and in cold conditions. We looked at it as an opportunity. ""When people say 'why haven't Canada qualified?' [for so long] you can see the challenges of managing the Concacaf window. Three games in seven days and thousands of miles of travelling to get those games done."" It is more than 20 years since Herdman, born in Consett in County Durham, left his job at Sunderland's academy to take over the New Zealand women's team. The decision has worked, to the extent that the 46-year-old would be an attractive proposition for a coaching role if he decided to return to his homeland. It is a conversation he skirts around, secure in the knowledge his contract with the Canadian FA does not expire until after the 2026 World Cup. ""There was a massive motivator at the time, when you haven't made it as a professional footballer,"" he said. ""You always have that chip on your shoulder.  ""I didn't play at the highest level and, in my earliest years in coaching, that was relayed to me quite frequently. It develops a mentality of working harder to prove you are at that level."" Davies' absence has been felt, but overall, Herdman refers to the 21-year-old as a ""generational talent"", capable of transporting Canadian soccer out of a niche environment and into mainstream society. ""He is an influencer, not only through what he has done on the field but through his social media presence,"" said Herdman.  ""I have an 11-year-old daughter who is obsessed with what he is doing on Tik-Tok. She has never had an interest in soccer all the way through her time in Canada.  ""We have a generation of fans for whom this is genuinely new. ""The hardcore fans are there setting the tone but the sports fans are the future now. They are going to fall in love with this sport.""

Brazil election: Lula and Bolsonaro to face run-off,"Mon, 03 Oct 2022 01:19:59 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-63112509,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-63112509?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Neither presidential candidate got more than 50% of the overall vote, meaning they will face off on 30 October.","Brazil's election is going into a second round in which left-winger Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva will face far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro. With almost all the votes counted, Lula had won 48% against Bolsonaro's 43% - a much closer result than opinion polls had suggested. But Lula fell short of the more than 50% of valid votes needed to prevent a run-off.  Voters now have four weeks to decide which of the two should lead Brazil. Winning outright in the first round was always going to be a tall order for any candidate - the last time it happened was 24 years ago. But President Bolsonaro and Lula had given their supporters hope that they could achieve just that. Both candidates can and will claim this as a victory, though. Lula has already said that this is a ""mere delay"" on his way to the presidency. For the 76-year-old former metal worker - who could not run in the 2018 election because he was in prison after being convicted on corruption charges which were later annulled - this spells a remarkable comeback. And President Bolsonaro, whom opinion polls had shown trailing far behind Lula, will rejoice in the fact that he proved the pollsters wrong, just as he had predicted he would.  This is a drama which has been years in the making. The two men are arch-rivals and spent much of the campaign trading insults. In the last TV debate before the vote, President Bolsonaro called Lula a thief, in reference to the corruption charges that put him in jail for 580 days before the conviction was annulled.  Lula, who has always maintained that the charges against him were politically motivated, has labelled Mr Bolsonaro a madman. Not surprisingly, that tension has filtered down into the streets. During the nights before the vote, neighbours here in Rio could be heard shouting ""Lula is a thief"" and ""Out with Bolsonaro"" at each other.   Since the two candidates are such polar opposites, much is at stake. Lula says he will bolster measures to protect the Amazon rainforest, while Mr Bolsonaro has argued that parts of the rainforest should be opened up to economic exploitation. Deforestation and forest fires have soared during President Bolsonaro's time in office. Climate activists have warned that if he is re-elected, the area could reach a tipping point.  Critics point out that Lula's environmental record during his time in office - he governed Brazil from 2003 to 2010 - was far from perfect.   But with Mr Bolsonaro counting on the agricultural sector and agribusiness for votes and support, it is Lula who is the preferred choice of climate activists.  However, voters in Brazil have many other pressing concerns, such as rising food prices, which have contributed to an increase in poverty and hunger. Mr Bolsonaro acknowledged these concerns in a statement after the results were out. ""I understand that a lot of the vote was down to the situation the Brazilian people are in. They are feeling the price rises, especially those of basic goods. I do understand that there's a desire for change but some change can be for the worse,"" he warned.  Many voters also mentioned education and Brazil's high levels of inequality as issues they want the new president to tackle.  Much of the campaign, however, was overshadowed by concern that Mr Bolsonaro may not accept defeat after he had said that ""only God"" could remove him from office.  He had also cast doubts on Brazil's electronic voting system, alleging - without providing any evidence - that it was open to fraud.  With the result much more favourable to him than predicted, he is now likely to concentrate more on how to sway those voters who cast their ballot for one of the other nine candidates who were eliminated in the first round. All eyes will now be on centrist Senator Simone Tebet, who came third in the election with 4%, and centre-left candidate Ciro Gomes, who came fourth with 3%. Both said that they would announce ""in the coming days"" who they would throw their weight behind for the run-off.  Lula, who seems to thrive on overcoming obstacles, has already announced that ""the fight continues until the final victory, that's our motto"".

The Queen rode in it to her coronation and in her Silver and Golden Jubilee processions. But this Jubilee it will be empty.  Drawn by eight Windsor Grey horses, the only reason to gawk at it will be its magnificent carvings, and the newsreel footage of the coronation that will be projected onto its windows. As with so much of this Jubilee year, the Queen will be unseen. In 1977, the year of her Silver Jubilee, she visited 36 different counties of the UK, as well as nine Commonwealth countries. A quarter of a century later, national and international tours marked her Golden Jubilee. A decade afterwards, in 2012, the international travel was left to other members of the Royal Family, whilst the Queen toured the UK. This year is very different. All the Palace will say is that the Queen ""hopes"" to attend the various ceremonies and celebrations being held in her honour.  The mobility problems that now bedevil her after a long lifetime of activity have ruled out participation in most events. And she has barely been seen in public for the last six months. When the Queen is seen at all this Jubilee, it will be mostly on the balcony of Buckingham Palace. You will be hard-pressed to find anyone who begrudges her absence from the celebrations; in more than seven decades of service, she has given so much. Hers will not be the only notable absence; her husband, Prince Philip, who quietly supported her throughout her reign, has gone. This is the first grand royal ceremonial to happen without him. Prince Andrew, tarnished by his friendship with a convicted sex offender and subsequent legal battles, will not be seen beside his mother on the Palace balcony. Nor will Prince Harry, who dramatically departed for the US a couple of years ago. Instead, front and centre will be her son and heir.  Prince Charles was the most senior member of the Royal Family at the Cenotaph in London on Remembrance Sunday late last year.  It was Prince Charles who led the Royal Maundy Service in April, one of the oldest royal-religious ceremonies, when by tradition the monarch gives money to the needy. And it was Prince Charles who read the Queen's Speech at the state opening of Parliament earlier this month. In the past six months, three of the great ceremonies of monarchy - military, religious and constitutional - have been led by the Prince of Wales.  In the most British way possible - undeclared, unwritten and unspoken-of - transition has begun. The 1977 Silver Jubilee was a chance to pause, with much of the reign to come, to look both back and forward. The 2002 Golden Jubilee was a reset after a storm-tossed decade of scandal, divorces and missteps.  In 2012, the Diamond Jubilee was a reaffirmation of the Queen's place in the nation's affections. This Platinum Jubilee will be different. Because this is farewell. Not to the Queen herself. She is, insiders say, except for her mobility problems, in good health. Nor to the Queen as sovereign. There is no suggestion of any formal change in constitutional role. But this weekend is a farewell to seven decades of public service to the nation, of her presence at the formal events each year that mark out the public sphere.  A return to the ceremonies of state seems unlikely. When the Queen is seen now, it is at events that are closer to her private affections than her public duties. An era is drawing to a close. And with this Jubilee, the nation has a chance to mark it with celebration and with thanks.

Climate change: 'Sand battery' could solve green energy's big problem,"Tue, 05 Jul 2022 00:12:10 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-61996520,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-61996520?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,A storage device made from sand may overcome the biggest issue in the transition to renewable energy.,"Finnish researchers have installed the world's first fully working ""sand battery"" which can store green power for months at a time.  The developers say this could solve the problem of year-round supply, a major issue for green energy. Using low-grade sand, the device is charged up with heat made from cheap electricity from solar or wind.  The sand stores the heat at around 500C, which can then warm homes in winter when energy is more expensive. Finland gets most of its gas from Russia, so the war in Ukraine has drawn the issue of green power into sharp focus.  It has the longest Russian border in the EU and Moscow has now halted gas and electricity supplies in the wake of Finland's decision to join NATO. Concerns over sources of heat and light, especially with the long, cold Finnish winter on the horizon are preoccupying politicians and citizens alike.  But in a corner of a small power plant in western Finland stands a new piece of technology that has the potential to ease some of these worries.  The key element in this device? Around 100 tonnes of builder's sand, piled high inside a dull grey silo. These rough and ready grains may well represent a simple, cost-effective way of storing power for when it's needed most.  Because of climate change and now thanks to the rapidly rising price of fossil fuels, there's a surge of investment in new renewable energy production. But while new solar panels and wind turbines can be quickly added to national grids, these extra sources also present huge challenges.  The toughest question is about intermittency - how do you keep the lights on when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow? Adding more renewables to the electricity grid also means you need to boost other energy sources to balance the network, as too much or too little power can cause it to collapse.  The most obvious answer to these problems is large scale batteries which can store and balance energy demands as the grid becomes greener.  Right now, most batteries are made with lithium and are expensive with a large, physical footprint, and can only cope with a limited amount of excess power.  But in the town of KankaanpÃ¤Ã¤, a team of young Finnish engineers have completed the first commercial installation of a battery made from sand that they believe can solve the storage problem in a low-cost, low impact way.  ""Whenever there's like this high surge of available green electricity, we want to be able to get it into the storage really quickly,"" said Markku YlÃ¶nen, one of the two founders of Polar Night Energy who have developed the product.  The device has been installed in the Vatajankoski power plant which runs the district heating system for the area.  Low-cost electricity warms the sand up to 500C by resistive heating (the same process that makes electric fires work).  This generates hot air which is circulated in the sand by means of a heat exchanger.  Sand is a very effective medium for storing heat and loses little over time. The developers say that their device could keep sand at 500C for several months.  So when energy prices are higher, the battery discharges the hot air which warms water for the district heating system which is then pumped around homes, offices and even the local swimming pool. The idea for the sand battery was first developed at a former pulp mill in the city of Tampere, with the council donating the work space and providing funding to get it off the ground.  ""If we have some power stations that are just working for a few hours in the wintertime, when it's the coldest, it's going to be extremely expensive,"" said Elina SeppÃ¤nen, an energy and climate specialist for the city. ""But if we have this sort of solution that provides flexibility for the use, and storage of heat, that would help a lot in terms of expense, I think."" One of the big challenges now is whether the technology can be scaled up to really make a difference - and will the developers be able to use it to get electricity out as well as heat?  The efficiency falls dramatically when the sand is used to just return power to the electricity grid.  But storing green energy as heat for the longer term is also a huge opportunity for industry, where most of the process heat that's used in food and drink, textiles or pharmaceuticals comes from the burning of fossil fuels. Other research groups, such as the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory are actively looking at sand as a viable form of battery for green power.  But the Finns are the first with a working, commercial system, that so far is performing well, according to the man who's invested in the system. ""It's really simple, but we liked the idea of trying something new, to be the first in the world to do something like this,"" said Pekka Passi, the managing director of the Vatajankoski power plant.  ""It's a bit crazy, if you wish, but I think it's going to be a success."" Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc.

Huge dinosaur skeleton unearthed in Portuguese garden,"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 16:01:38 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-62693077,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-62693077?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The massive discovery was made during building work on a house in Pombal in central Portugal.,"The remains of what could be the largest dinosaur ever discovered in Europe are being excavated in a Portuguese back garden. The fossilised skeleton of a sauropod was discovered in the central city of Pombal in 2017, when a man began building work on his house. Sauropods were the biggest of all dinosaurs and the largest land animals to have ever lived. They had long necks and tails, ate plants and walked on four legs.  Earlier this month, palaeontologists from Portugal and Spain unearthed parts of the spine and ribs of a possible brachiosaurid sauropod which suggest the huge reptile was about 12m (39ft) tall and 25m (82ft) long. The skeleton has been found in Upper Jurassic sedimentary rocks, suggesting it is about 150 million years old. The skeleton - found in the position that the dinosaur probably died in - is now being studied by an international research team. Because of the relatively intact positioning of the skeleton, palaeontologists working on the dig are hopeful that there is more of it they are yet to unearth. ""It is not usual to find all the ribs of an animal like this, let alone in this position, maintaining their original anatomical position,"" Elisabete Malafaia, post-doctoral researcher at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon, told the Phys.org website.

"Terrorism: Lone actors make stopping attacks harder, say FBI and MI5 chiefs","Fri, 08 Jul 2022 19:33:32 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-62095852,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-62095852?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,US and UK security services say the rise of lone actors means less intelligence on potential attacks.,"Finding intelligence to stop terrorism is getting harder because attackers are increasingly lone actors, the head of the FBI has told a meeting in London. Christopher Wray said the US security services and MI5 are seeing more attacks carried out with crude weapons and little planning or training. At the end of joint meetings with MI5, Mr Wray said it was vital for security services to share intelligence quickly. MI5 head Ken McCallum said they faced a ""very difficult cocktail of risks"". The FBI director said there are ""very few dots out there"", referring to intelligence on planned attacks, adding there was less time to connect those dots.  Working with MI5 in some cases was vital, he explained.. ""If we're not super lashed-up, we're going to miss the only picture that's out there - and it's got to happen really fast,"" he said. He said travel and technology had ""blurred the lines between foreign and domestic threats"" and that the encryption provided by technology companies was providing ""an entirely unfettered space"" for criminals and terrorists to operate. Mr McCallum said around one in five terrorism investigations in Great Britain were linked to neo-Nazi, racist ideology or other related extremism - a rate that had remained roughly steady.  He said MI5 continued to see a growing role for juveniles and an obsessive interest in weaponry. The two men said that co-operation allowed their agencies to cover a broader range of threats. The FBI director said he had met British intelligence and security officials during his visit this week, which came as he marked 80 years of formal co-operation between the FBI and the UK. On Friday afternoon his visit included looking at case studies of Russian and Chinese intelligence operatives moving around the globe.  Mr McCallum said the expulsion of Russian diplomats after the Salisbury poisonings in 2018 and continued refusal of visas had prevented Moscow rebuilding its presence and had constrained the threat in the UK.  Cyber threats had also been high on the agenda for discussions, Mr Wray said. On Wednesday, the two security chiefs made an unprecedented joint public appearance to warn of an ""immense"" threat from China.  They spoke to business and academic leaders inside MI5 headquarters at Thames House in central London.

In the room where Ukraine orders arms from the West,"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 16:01:45 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61816337,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61816337?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"From an attic room in Germany, the West coordinates the supply of arms to Ukraine - but is it enough?","The BBC has been allowed rare access to the military nerve centre where Western powers are coordinating efforts to supply weapons and ammunition to Ukraine.   In the attic of an austere US military barracks in the German city of Stuttgart, dozens of military personnel from 26 nations are working round the clock to deliver weapons to Ukraine.  From this room, Western allies have already helped deliver nearly $8bn (Â£6.6bn) worth of weapons and ammunition to Ukraine's armed forces. That's 66,000 tonnes - the equivalent of 5,000 London double-decker buses, as one British officer worked out.  Most of what happens at Patch Barracks is highly classified. We are asked to leave all electronic devices behind and we are not allowed to film or talk to the Ukrainians who are part of the International Donors Coordination Cell (IDCC).  Military personnel from dozens of countries bash the phones and pore over computer screens. They include a small team from Ukraine, led by a three-star general. At the start of each day he sets out what his country needs. The situation in the Donbas appears increasingly bleak, but here in Stuttgart there's more a sense of urgency than panic.   Around one set of desks a team is tasked with locating supplies. Sometimes they'll find a nation willing to provide weapons, but will then have to track another country for the right ammunition or the means to transport them. They've now developed a database where the Ukrainians can list their priorities. Donor nations can access that information and decide what they're willing and able to supply.  Brig Chris King, the senior British officer, says that military aid is being delivered by air, road, rail and sea and to multiple locations ""in order to ensure we don't have any single points of failure"".  He says that Russia has tried to step up its attacks on supply lines but there's been no ""significant"" interruption to their delivery.  I ask if any supplies have been hit.  ""Yes, I presume so,"" he replies. The task of moving the weapons and ammunition across the border is left to the Ukrainians themselves, says Rear Adm Duke Heinz, the senior US commander at the IDCC. ""In Poland and the other countries, the Ukrainians come and get it - so they're the ones who determine how it gets across the border."" Once the weapons cross the border, they can arrive at the front line ""within 48 hours"".    Recently there have been alarming warnings from Ukraine that the flow of weapons is too little and too late. As Russia continues to bombard the Donbas, pleas for more help are sounding more desperate by the day. Ukraine's deputy defence minister says that, so far, the country has only received 10% of what it has asked for.  Here in Stuttgart, Rear Adm Heinz gives a very different message: ""I am confident they are not going to run out of ammunition.""  Despite the grim news from the Donbas, he says ""I wouldn't say they're losing, I'd say they're holding their own.""   Ukraine's demands have changed significantly over the past few months. The IDCC was set up in late February - bringing together two separate efforts being led by the US and the UK. At the start of the war they were sending small arms and ammunition - such as anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles. Now Ukrainians are asking for heavier weapons - artillery, multiple rocket launchers and air defence systems.  In the early days of the war the IDCC tried to source stocks of old Soviet weapons and ammunition from former Soviet bloc countries - the same systems Ukraine's armed forces had been using for decades. Brig King says those supplies have slowly been running out. There is now just one factory in Europe that produces Soviet-compatible 152mm artillery ammunition.    Slowly, they have been transitioning to Nato-standard equipment. Over the past few months Ukraine has been sent more than 100 M777 US howitzers and 300,000 rounds of 155mm ammunition.  This brings an additional challenge, as Ukrainian forces need to be trained in how to use the weapons and ammunition. The IDCC is organising that training outside Ukraine. Some Ukrainian troops are now being trained in the UK on new artillery guns and British-supplied multiple rocket launchers. Simpler systems can be taught virtually, using videos and training manuals. Neither Rear Adm Heinz nor Brig King believe this war will be over quickly. They both say they're preparing to carry on this work for the long term. When I ask the brigadier for how long, he replies, ""It's not going to be months, I think we'll be here for a number of years.""  But there are some within Nato who question whether the West is really geared up for a war that could go on for years. It could certainly test its unity, resolve and limited stocks of weapons and ammunition.  In Stuttgart they know the stakes couldn't be higher. Rear Adm Heinz describes the mission of providing Ukraine with weapons and ammunition as ""the most important work this command has done"" since US EUCOM (European Command) was set up in 1952.  Brig King calls it ""a generational moment"" and says the choice is stark: ""We either help Ukraine to fight or we accept that, maybe not straight away but in the next few years, we're going to be fighting somewhere else. If we don't do enough we will sow the seeds for future conflict.""

Verstappen wins GP after late overtake,"Sun, 27 Mar 2022 18:35:00 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/60895402,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/60895402?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Max Verstappen wins an intense race-long battle with Charles Leclerc to take his first victory of the season in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.,"Max Verstappen won an intense race-long battle with Charles Leclerc to take his first victory of the season in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix. The Red Bull driver passed the Ferrari with four laps to go after the two had duelled during a tense race. The battle occasionally bordered on farce as the two slowed down almost to a stop at times to try to work the DRS overtaking zones to their advantage. But Verstappen edged it by 0.5 seconds after making the decisive move. The two were in a league of their own out front as Ferrari's Carlos Sainz and Red Bull's Sergio Perez took third and fourth. George Russell finished fifth for Mercedes, ahead of Alpine's Esteban Ocon and McLaren's Lando Norris. Lewis Hamilton recovered from starting 15th to finish 10th. The excitement meant a difficult weekend for F1 ended on a high, but the drivers and other senior figures unnerved by Friday's missile strike on a nearby oil depot are unlikely to allow the sport's bosses to forget what has been an uncomfortable three days in the desert. Just two races into the season, it already feels as if this year could distil, like last one, into a two-horse race, with Leclerc replacing Hamilton as Verstappen's main rival. Leclerc moved to the front after Ferrari appeared to trick Red Bull into making a pit stop with Perez, who started from pole and led the early laps. A radio conversation asked Leclerc to ""push to box"" but he stayed out as Perez pitted. After the race, Leclerc said the team had agreed to do the opposite of Red Bull, who said their plan had always been to pit that lap. So Leclerc stayed out. Ferrari's plan was now to run longer and make ground with what they hoped was Leclerc's extra pace. But events came to Leclerc's aid as Nicholas Latifi crashed his Williams and brought out the safety car on the next lap, gifting Leclerc, Verstappen and Sainz a 'free' stop and dropping Perez down to the fourth place he would retain to the end. Leclerc nailed the restart and retained the lead. For lap after lap, Verstappen trailed him, at about 1.5-second distance, but Leclerc appeared to be able to hold him at bay. But a virtual safety car period with 12 laps to go changed the race, as a result of a bizarre sequence of events as first Daniel Ricciardo's McLaren and then Fernando Alonso's Alpine ground to a halt in the entry to the pit lane. On the restart, Verstappen was suddenly on Leclerc's tail and the Ferrari driver could not shake him. At first, Leclerc tried the same tactics that won him the first race of the season in Bahrain, letting Verstappen pass him at the end of one DRS overtaking zone - at the last corner in Jeddah - so he could have the boost from the DRS aid down the pit straight into Turn One. That worked on lap 42 into lap 43, after which Leclerc set the fastest lap trying to break away from the Red Bull. And the next time around, both slammed on the brakes into the last corner - Verstappen locking all four tyres - as they played chicken with the DRS trigger line. But Verstappen came back at him. At the end of lap 45, Leclerc made an error into the last corner and lost a little time.  Then, on the following lap, they were again together into the final corner. Verstappen rounded it on Leclerc's tail, an oversteer snap slowed the Ferrari's exit, and the DRS overtaking aid did the rest, Verstappen moving past down the straight with the final pass of the race. Full race results Norman, Mickelson & Saudi money: is golf eating itself? 'Questions remain over racing in Saudi Arabia' Perez was unlucky to lose out with the safety car. The rest of the race suggested he did not have the underlying pace to hold Leclerc, and Red Bull would surely have ordered him to let Verstappen by had the Dutchman been behind him. But he also lost out to Sainz by the closest of margins. As Sainz exited the pits, he was marginally ahead of Perez at the safety car line on the track. Perez moved ahead on the exit of the corner, but this was against the rules, and Perez had to cede position on the restart. After that, it was a lonely race for the second drivers of the top teams, and also for George Russell in the Mercedes, comfortably clear of the midfielders but unable to challenger the leaders. Hamilton at one point looked as if he might finish sixth or seventh, had things gone his way. The caution period he was awaiting with his long first stint did happen. The team called Hamilton in, but seeing Alonso's car moving slowly and double waved yellow flags, he did not know whether he could overtake. He slowed and lost nearly six seconds and also decided not to pit, which meant he had to wait another two laps until the virtual safety car ended to pit. The dropped him to 12th, but he passed a couple of cars in the final stages of the race to take the final point, behind Alpha Tauri's Pierre Gasly and Haas' Kevin Magnussen. Alonso and Alfa Romeo's Valtteri Bottas were also on for decent points hauls before their mid-race retirements. Only two contenders here, but Verstappen nails it for a controlled and mature drive before applying clever racing judgement and higher straight-line speed to overhaul Leclerc at the end A two-week break before the Australian Grand Prix, as F1 returns to Melbourne for the first time since the 2020 event was called off as the pandemic took hold around the globe.

Historic English pubs recognised for their interiors,"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 05:11:21 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-61797983,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-61797983?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Historic England says the interiors help ""tell the fascinating story of pubs over the centuries"".","Eleven pubs across England have been recognised for their historic or unusual interiors. The pubs have been listed, upgraded or relisted by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport on the advice of Historic England. The Grade II Bridge Inn in Topsham, Devon is among those relisted. Historic England said the interiors help ""tell the fascinating story of pubs over the centuries and how they reflected society"". The other pubs can be found in Leeds, London, Hampshire, Oxfordshire, Suffolk and Lancashire. The Bridge Inn has been run by the same family since 1897 and retains many of its historic features. It includes a panelled corridor, rare historic glazed advertising, a stone fireplace and a hatch through which drinks are fetched. It has been relisted to update the way it was described on the National Heritage List, which was written 30 years ago. The list of pubs was put forward by the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) Pub Heritage Group, as part of a collaboration with Historic England. Duncan Wilson, chief executive of Historic England said: ""At a time when many historic pubs in England are susceptible to change or at risk of closure, we are pleased to celebrate pubs that have kept their remarkable interiors.  ""These rare interiors help tell the fascinating story of pubs over the centuries and how they reflected society."" Heritage Minister Nigel Huddleston said: ""Our historic pubs are national institutions that have sat at the heart of local communities for generations, bringing people together and shining a light on our shared past.  ""These listings recognise and celebrate the importance of the local pub to people across the country and will make sure their legacy endures for many years to come.""

Abortion in US: How misinformation has fuelled the debate,"Sun, 24 Jul 2022 23:46:08 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-61986389,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-61986389?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Claims about health concerns and legal rights are intensifying the strength of feeling.,"The debate over abortion rights in the United States has been accompanied by widespread misinformation about health concerns and legal rights. We've looked at some of the most controversial issues and the facts behind them.   The American Center for Law and Justice, a Christian legal advice centre with 3.7 million Facebook followers, has written a widely-shared post claiming that ""abortion is not safe"" and calling on the US Supreme Court to reject arguments that it is. This is a common claim but it's not supported by evidence.  While all medical procedures carry some risk, the US-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that between 2013 and 2018 there were 0.4 deaths per 100,000 legal abortions in the US.  This compares with 23.8 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2020.  In a recent court case in Florida, obstetrician and anti-abortion campaigner Dr Ingrid Skop recommended setting the abortion limit at 15 weeks, saying the procedure became more ""difficult and dangerous"" after this point. Complications do increase slightly with abortions carried out in later pregnancy, but a report by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine says serious complications remain very rare. In the US, 98% of all abortions take place within the first 15 weeks. During roughly the first 10-12 weeks of pregnancy, a non-surgical abortion can be carried out by taking two drugs - mifepristone and misoprostol. This has become the most common abortion method in the US and is widely considered by expert bodies to be safe. However, anti-abortion campaign group Students for Life of America, is one of several that claims the medication is dangerous. The group said in a post on Facebook: ""If the abortion industry truly cared about women's health they wouldn't encourage women to put their health and lives at risk with dangerous chemical drugs."" The Food and Drug Administration reports a rate of 0.35 deaths per 100,000 medication abortions - once again, a very low rate compared with the risks from live births. As the use of abortion pills has grown, another trend has emerged - the promotion of ""abortion-reversal pills"", advertised as a way to halt the procedure if a patient changes her mind after having taken the first of the two abortion pills. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says there is no evidence that these ""reversal"" pills are effective.   And a trial of this method had to be halted before the results could be gathered, after three out of the 12 participants experienced dangerous levels of bleeding. Despite this, promoters of abortion reversal point to research that they say shows the drugs do work, and to case studies as proof. These studies have been criticised as poorly designed and ignore the fact that some pregnancies would continue anyway if only one of the two required abortion pills had been taken.  Nevertheless, at least eight US states have passed laws requiring doctors to inform people having medication abortions about these ""reversal pills"" as an available option. ""The treatment for an ectopic pregnancy, a septic uterus, or a miscarriage that your body won't release, is abortion. If you can't get those abortions, you die,"" reads one Twitter post.  There are hundreds of similar posts circulating online, suggesting these life-saving treatments will be prevented in states introducing strict abortion laws.  All US states that have or are preparing to introduce bans on abortion have exceptions in their proposed legislation to save the life of the woman. In Arkansas, where abortion is banned except to save the woman's life, legislation states that the removal of a potentially life-threatening ectopic pregnancy - where an egg is fertilised outside the womb - is ""not an abortion"".  Nevertheless, concerns remain over the health consequences for women of stricter abortion laws. Dr DeShawn Taylor, who runs a family-planning clinic, providing abortions in Arizona, has experienced this first-hand, having treated women with ectopic pregnancies who had been turned away from emergency departments. She said: ""The physician, who would be tasked with providing them the life-saving medication... won't do it because of their beliefs."" And, she adds, doctors may delay treatment, allowing patients' condition to worsen, until it's really clear it is life threatening.  Posts shared hundreds of thousands of times have suggested a woman who has been raped could serve a longer sentence for having an abortion than her rapist would.  However, most states that have imposed abortion bans target punishments at the abortion provider rather than the person having the abortion. Penalties already in place for abortion providers vary from one year in Ohio, for example, to life imprisonment in Texas and Alabama.  So, could the punishment for a rapist in Alabama be less than that for the doctor who provides the abortion, as this tweet claims? In Alabama, the most serious category of rape - having sex with someone who is incapacitated and incapable of consent, or who is less than 12 years old and the offender is 16 or older - is a class-A felony, punishable by up to 99 years in prison. The next-most serious category - which could include an adult having sex with a 12-year-old - carries a maximum sentence of 20 years. So it's possible that an abortion provider could face a more severe penalty than a rapist in Alabama. However, much is still unknown about how the laws are going to be enforced.

Uvalde shooting: Gunman could have been stopped within three minutes - safety official,"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 18:00:25 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-61877914,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-61877914?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Police could have stopped the Uvalde school shooting within three minutes, Texas's safety chief says.","There were enough police on the scene of the Uvalde, Texas school shooting to have stopped the gunman three minutes after he entered the building, Texas's public safety chief has testified. Steven McCraw told a state Senate hearing the police response was an ""abject failure"". He accused the on-scene commander of placing officers' lives above the children's. Police waited for over an hour outside classrooms before a team made entry.   Mr McCraw, Director of the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), told the public hearing: ""The officers had weapons, the children had none. The officers had body armour, the children had none. The officers had training, the subject had none. One hour, 14 minutes, and eight seconds - that is how long the children waited, and the teachers waited, in Room 111 to be rescued. ""Three minutes after the subject entered the west building, there was a sufficient number of armed officers wearing body armour to isolate, distract and neutralise the subject."" Many parents and relatives have expressed deep anger at the police handling of the mass shooting, which killed 21 people -19 students and two teachers - at Robb Elementary School on 24 May.  The DPS chief said the scene commander, Uvalde schools police chief Pete Arredondo, ""waited for radio and rifles, and he waited for shields and he waited for SWAT"". Earlier in June, Mr Arredondo said he had not considered himself the incident commander, and did not order police to hold back. He also told the Texas Tribune that he had left his two radios outside the school to keep his hands free to hold his gun. Earlier on Tuesday the first images emerged showing armed police with rifles and at least one ballistic shield waiting in a school corridor. The Austin American-Statesman and KVUE-TV, which have seen investigative documents, said police had arrived earlier in the attack and with more firepower than was previously reported. The new information shows Mr Arredondo tried to speak to the gunman, asking him whether he could hear him, the Austin American-Statesman says. Police waited for a master key to arrive so that the classroom doors could be opened, even though it had not been established that the doors were locked, while tools were also available that could have been used to break them down, the Texas Tribune reported.  The gunman was eventually shot dead by members of the US Border Patrol Tactical Unit. During the attack, children were frantically calling 911 to report multiple gunshot victims. Worried parents also tried to rush into the school, as police physically prevented them from entering.   Texas police have not publicly commented on the latest reports. The attack by an 18-year-old - identified as Salvador Ramos - has led to renewed national debate about gun regulations. On Monday, parents of the victims and other members of the community called for the resignation of Mr Arredondo at a meeting of the school's board.

"Pentaquarks: scientists find new ""exotic"" configurations of quarks","Tue, 05 Jul 2022 09:13:39 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-62027238,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-62027238?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"They hope they will help us understand the ""strong force"" that holds the insides of atoms together.","Scientists have found new ways in which quarks, the tiniest particles known to humankind, group together. The new structures exist for just a hundred thousandth of a billionth of a billionth of a second but may explain how our Universe is formed. Atoms contain smaller particles called neutrons and protons, which are made up of three quarks each. ""Exotic"" matter discovered in recent years is made up of four and five quarks - tetraquarks and pentaquarks. Scientists at the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland have discovered one new pentaquark and two tetraquarks. This takes the total number discovered there to 21. Each is unique, but researchers are excited about the qualities of the three new finds. The new pentaquark decays into particles that none of the others produce, while the two tetraquarks have the same mass, suggesting they may be the first known pair of exotic structures. Perhaps even more importantly, though, the latest finds mean that there are now enough of these particles to begin grouping them together, like the chemical elements in the periodic table. That is an essential first step towards creating a theory and set of rules governing exotic mass. In light of the new discoveries, physicists are discussing this very issue at a special seminar on Tuesday at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, which houses the Large Hadron Collider. Working out minuscule differences between the tiniest things we know about may seem arcane, but the interaction of quarks creates the so-called ""strong force"" that holds the insides of atoms - and by extension our entire Universe - together. ""The strong force is extremely difficult to calculate, and we don't have firm predictions of how the exotic pentaquarks and tetraquarks are built,"" says Prof Chris Parkes of Manchester University. ""But we hope that by finding out about them we can develop theories that enable us to understand them better."" A Greek philosopher, Democritus, put forward the idea in the fifth century BC that the world was made up of indivisible particles which he called atoms.  By the end of the 19th and early 20th century, experimental results showed that atoms were made up of smaller particles: electrons, neutrons and protons.   And in the 1960s, it became clear that neutrons and protons themselves were made from smaller particles still, called quarks; and that the interaction of quarks was tied to one of the fundamental forces of nature called the strong force.  The force not only holds the insides of atoms together, but is important in the interactions of other sub-atomic particles that make the Universe tick. The Large Hadron Collider has undergone a major upgrade and the researchers involved believe that they will discover many more such exotic particles, some of which may have six quarks bound together. Some of these may have a less fleeting existence - perhaps a hundred billionth of a second. That is brief by human standards, but because these particles travel at close to the speed of light, they would leave trails a few millimetres long, which would be a treasured footprint for physicist sleuths to follow.

Prince Charles guest edits special edition of The Voice,"Sat, 27 Aug 2022 23:55:44 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-62701624,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-62701624?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"The issue features interviews with Idris Elba, Bernadine Evaristo and Baroness Lawrence.","Prince Charles has edited an edition of British black newspaper The Voice to mark its 40th anniversary. Founded in 1982, it is the only newspaper in the UK that predominantly covers black issues and culture. The royal said he was ""so touched"" to be asked, saying the paper had ""become an institution"" over the years. Clarence House said Prince Charles's edit celebrates some of the achievements of the black community over the last four decades. Published next week, the issue features interviews with Luther star Idris Elba, who tells how a Prince's Trust grant at the age of 16 ""opened doors that changed my life"", and Booker Prize-winning author Bernardine Evaristo, who reflects on her career and her role as president of the Royal Society of Literature. It also features an interview with Baroness Lawrence, mother of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence, who talks about a new partnership between the Stephen Lawrence Day Foundation and The Prince's Foundation. The two organisations have joined forces to provide applied arts scholarships for young people from diverse backgrounds affected by social and economic inequality. It also celebrates Notting Hill Carnival, the annual Caribbean festival that takes place in west London over the August bank holiday, and carries an interview with Baroness Floella Benjamin, who talks about her latest Windrush project. Speaking about the issue, Prince Charles said: ""Over the last four decades, with all the enormous changes that they have witnessed, Britain's only surviving black newspaper has become an institution and a crucial part of the fabric of our society. ""This is why I was so touched to be invited to edit this special edition."" The Prince has previously guest edited other publications, including several editions of Country Life to commemorate his 65th and 72nd birthday. Paulette Simpson, the newspaper's executive editor, said his involvement acknowledges the paper's efforts to create a more inclusive society. Lester Holloway, The Voice's editor, said: ""Our readers may be surprised at the parallels between the issues which The Voice has campaigned on for four decades and the work the Prince of Wales has been involved in over the same period, often behind the scenes. ""In past decades these causes were once scorned and ridiculed, but today they are widely acknowledged."" Mr Holloway added that ""all the research tells us how far we have to go to be a truly equal society"". ""The Prince has an awareness of this, and that in itself is a reason to be hopeful,"" he added. The special edition of The Voice will be available to purchase on 1 September.

Shakhtar draw ends Celtic's European hopes,"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 20:59:33 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63353370,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63353370?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,A wonder strike from Shakhtar Donetsk's precocious forward Mykhaylo Mudryk denies Celtic a first Champions League win and ended their hopes of European football after Christmas.," Last updated on 25 October 202225 October 2022.From the section Champions League A wonder strike from Shakhtar Donetsk's precocious forward Mykhaylo Mudryk denied Celtic a first Champions League win this term and ended their hopes of European football after Christmas. Mudryk - who has been linked with Europe's top clubs - charged forward on the counter and smashed in a stunning equaliser for the Ukrainian side, who could yet reach the last 16. Giorgos Giakoumakis had rifled in Celtic's first home goal in the competition for over five hours, but they could not find another. Kyogo Furuhashi had the best of their chances to get back in front, but the striker shot tamely when clean through, as Celtic threw the kitchen sink at Shakhtar in a bid to find the win which they needed to have a chance of finishing third in Group F and dropping into the Europa League. Instead, Shakhtar got the draw which ensures they will finish at least third - and potentially second - and the visitors also had the best shot at a winner when Mudryk burst through and squared for Danylo Sikan, who inexplicably failed to tap into an empty net. Ange Postecoglou's Celtic will finish last in the section, but will try to leave their mark in their final match against holders Real Madrid at the Bernabeu, while Shakhtar host RB Leipzig in the race for the last 16. Celtic's downfall throughout the group stage has been an inability to convert chances when on top alongside having their frantic press picked off later in games. But at Celtic Park there were fewer clear-cut scoring opportunities, with Giakoumakis' well-taken finish from close-range marking a more clinical start. But a well-organised Shakhtar side showed a glimpse of their threat on the break through Mudryk, who was only denied when in on goal by Joe Hart's outstretched arm just before half-time. Shakhtar and Mudryk have been one of the stories of the competition having defied expectations throughout, and all of the visitors' chances came through the 21-year-old with searing pace. His goal was a stunning moment as he nipped around Cameron Carter-Vickers before cutting inside and blasting the ball into the top corner, and he showed the same quickness when he put the ball on a plate for Sikan, who somehow missed a gaping goal with a heavy first touch. Celtic huffed and puffed until the end, but Matt O'Riley's side-foot effort wide of the post was the best chance they could muster after Kyogo shot straight at the goalkeeper, following a well-worked move. It's been a tough learning curve for the Scottish champions, but they would have expected better from themselves. Celtic's campaign has been marked by profligacy, but this was not a case of the Scottish champions missing chance after chance. Kyogo's miss was the only gilt-edged opportunity which was passed up at Celtic Park. Instead, moves broke down at the final pass or cross. Part of the credit for that has to go to a well-organised Shakhtar who, with all their documented problems associated with the war in their homeland, have been a feel-good story this season. They were well set up, and in Mudryk possess a superstar in the making who is so dangerous on the break. Postecoglou has spoken about testing his style at the highest level in order to improve, and Celtic will definitely need to do that if they get back to this stage next season. If they can find a more clinical edge and improve their press off the ball in order to stifle teams without leaving gaps, they will make more of a mark. But there are no guarantees against the best sides, and it relies on both keeping hold of their best players as well as adding quality. Celtic boss Ange Postecoglou: ""It was a tight game. A lot on the line for both clubs. I thought we were pretty much in control. They caught us on the counter and scored. ""We had a chance with Kyogo - we miss. They had a big chance - they miss. It was a typical, tight Champions League game, but we couldn't get the result we wanted."" Celtic midfielder Matt O'Riley: ""We'll try to be back next year with more ruthlessness in front of goal. ""I had one at the end that was a big chance. To be honest, if that's in the Scottish league, I reckon we score them. Maybe it's just a bit of anxiety, I'm not sure.""

Euro 2022: Grace Geyoro scores hat-trick as France thrash Italy,"Sun, 10 Jul 2022 21:55:01 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62109410,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62109410?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Grace Geyoro scores a hat-trick as France show why they are among the Euro 2022 favourites by thrashing Italy in their Group D opener in Rotherham.," Last updated on 10 July 202210 July 2022.From the section Women's Euro 2022 Grace Geyoro scored a hat-trick as France underlined their credentials as one of the favourites to win Euro 2022 by thrashing Italy 5-1 in their Group D opener at Rotherham's New York Stadium. Corinne Diacre's side are looking to win a major tournament for the first time, and they put in a performance that will certainly make other teams sit up and take notice. Italian forward Barbara Bonansea forced a great save out of goalkeeper Pauline Peyraud-Magnin in the first few minutes, but from then things took a bad turn for Italy as France put on an attacking masterclass. Geyoro got the first of her goals in the ninth minute when she fired home from the lively Kadidiatou Diani's cross.  Marie-Antoinette Katoto, widely tipped to win the Golden Boot at this tournament, scored her 26th international goal in her 31st appearance just three minutes later, stabbing in after the goalkeeper had palmed a shot into her path. Katoto then saw a header hit the post before Delphine Cascarino made it 3-0 with a thunderous strike six minutes before the break. There was still time for France to score twice more before half-time as Geyoro rolled in after rounding the goalkeeper, before she completed her hat-trick with with a neat finish from 14 yards. To Italy's credit, they did improve after the break, although they were fortunate to finish the game with 10 players when Sara Gama had a red card overturned following a VAR review, despite the challenge appearing reckless. Martina Piemonte then headed in with 14 minutes remaining to give the travelling Italy fans a consolation to cheer. ""We wanted to show what we were made of,"" Diacre said. ""Hats off to my players. They were high performing from the get go. We felt great synergy between the players on the pitch.  ""The proof is in the pudding, we saw this in the first half."" Ranked third in the world and arriving at the tournament on the back of 14 consecutive victories, France are rightly viewed as being among the leading contenders to win Euro 2022 - even if, to date, success at major tournaments has eluded them. They have failed to progress further than the quarter-finals in their six previous appearances at the European Women's Championships, however this performance showed that they have the intention and quality to go much further this time. Italy simply had no answer to France's brilliant attack in the first half, with Diani's trickery and direct running causing panic in the defence, while Katoto - who in addition to her goal provided the assist for Geyoro's second - highlighted why she is a striker to be feared at Euro 2022. On this showing, no defence will want to come up against this France attack, which blended skill, pace and clinical finishing to devastating effect. Having failed to get out of the group stage in 2017, Italy were hoping to do much better this time around. But such a heavy defeat in their opening game is far from an ideal start. However, they can take heart from their second-half display. As outclassed as they were in the opening 45 minutes, they competed after the break and were unfortunate to not have more than the one consolation goal. That may have been down to France stepping off in attack to conserve energy, but Italy should take encouragement from how they finished the game as they look to get up and running against Iceland on Thursday.

Queen of Country music Loretta Lynn dies aged 90,"Tue, 04 Oct 2022 16:48:27 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-63134852,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-63134852?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"The singer's hits included Coal Miner's Daughter, Honky Tonk Girl and feminist anthem The Pill.","Loretta Lynn, whose songs of strength and independence made her a standard-bearer for women in country music, has died at the age of 90. Known as the Queen of Country, her songs were rooted in real-life experience, most notably on the autobiographical Coal Miner's Daughter. Other hits included Don't Come Home A-Drinkin', Honky Tonk Girl and the feminist anthem, The Pill. Lynn's family said she died on Tuesday at her home in Tennessee. ""Our precious mom, Loretta Lynn, passed away peacefully this morning, October 4th, in her sleep at home in her beloved ranch in Hurricane Mills,"" the family said in a statement.  They asked for privacy as they grieve and said a memorial would be announced later.   The singer was born Loretta Webb in a one-room log cabin in Butcher Hollow, Kentucky in 1932. She was the second of eight children. Just as she would later sing in Coal Miner's Daughter, her family eked out a living during the Depression, with her father earning a ""poor man's dollar"" by working all night in the coal mines, and all day in the fields ""a-hoein' corn"".

The family made its own entertainment - her mother played guitar, with her father accompanying on banjo - and she grew up on the songs of the Carter Family. ""I was singing when I was born, I think,"" she told the Associated Press in 2016. ""Daddy used to come out on the porch where I would be singing and rocking the babies to sleep.  ""He'd say, 'Loretta, shut that big mouth. People all over this holler can hear you.' And I said, 'Daddy, what difference does it make? They are all my cousins.'"" At the age of 15, she attended a ""pie social"" - where local girls would bake a pie, and men would bid to win both the food and a meeting with the cook.  Loretta's pie, accidentally baked with salt instead of sugar, was won by Oliver Lynn, a 21-year-old solider, who swept her off her feet. A month later, they married and moved to Custer, Washington, where they raised four children. Her husband, whom she called ""Doo"" or ""Doolittle,"" urged her to sing professionally and bought her a $17 (Â£15) Sears guitar, with which she started a band, Loretta and the Trailblazers, that also featured her brother Jay Lee Webb. By 1960, she had signed a contract with Zero Records and released her debut single, I'm a Honky Tonk Girl.  The song was inspired by a woman Lynn befriended in Washington, whose husband had left her for another woman. Lynn said she wrote the song while leaning up against an old toilet in her house, the words pouring out of her in a 10-minute burst of inspiration. She and her husband promoted the song relentlessly, driving to radio stations around the country to pester DJs into playing it, and sending out hundreds of free discs. Allow YouTube content?

I'm A Honky Tonk Girl reached number 14 on the country charts, and Lynn relocated to Nashville, where she was quickly snapped up by Decca Records.  She released her first Decca record, Success, in 1962, beginning an impressive stretch of hits that continued into the 1990s. Lynn earned her first number one with Don't Come Home a Drinkin' (With Lovin' on Your Mind) in 1966, and topped the US country charts another 15 times.  She recorded 60 albums in total, and was nominated for 18 Grammy Awards, winning three. Her songs frequently depicted broken relationships and unhappy homes - but were unusual for expressing a female point of view at a time when that was unheard of in country music.  Many addressed Doolittle's infidelity and alcoholism. You Ain't Woman Enough (To Take My Man) and Fist City were feisty warnings to any woman who considered approaching her husband, while 1971's I Wanna Be Free fantasised about divorce.  ""I'm gonna take this chain from around my finger / And throw it just as far as I can sling,"" sang Lynn. ""I've wrote every song I ever wrote about him,"" she told a BBC Arena documentary. ""He gave me a lot of opportunities."" Lynn later confessed that the relationship could turn violent - although she gave as good as she got. ""If he smacked me or anything, I'd stand up and be fightin' him just like I'd be fightin' the other woman,"" she told PBS's American Masters documentary in 2016. ""He'd smack me, I'd smack him; he'd pull my hair, I pulled his hair. That's the way it was.""  Despite their troubles, the couple stayed together for 48 years until Oliver's death in 1996. Lynn's songs weren't just about relationships, however. Dear Sam was inspired by the women left at home during the Vietnam War, with lyrics that ran: ""Don't misunderstand/ I know he's fighting for our land / I really love my country/ But I also love my man"", while The Pill was a frank and funny celebration of reproductive choice.  ""This old maternity dress I've got is going in the garbage/The clothes I'm wearing from now on won't take up so much yardage,"" sang the star. ""Miniskirts, hot pants and a few little fancy frills/Yeah, I'm making up for all those years since I've got the pill."" Although she wasn't initially credited as a writer, it later transpired she had played a part in its composition. Speaking to NPR in 2010, the mother of six said the lyrics spoke directly to her own experiences. ""If I'd had [the pill] I would have used it,"" she said. ""'Cause back when I was having all the kids, we didn't have birth-control pills. Or if we did, I didn't know anything about them."" The subject matter meant her record label held the single back for several years. When it was finally released in 1975, many country radio stations refused to play it, keeping it from hitting number one. But it still reached the top five, and became Lynn's biggest crossover pop hit. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

By that time, Lynn had begun a professional partnership with country star Conway Twitty, with whom she scored hits like After the Fire Is Gone, Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man and As Soon As I Hang Up The Phone. The musicians were named vocal duo of the year by the Country Music Association for four consecutive years from 1972 to 1975. Lynn published her autobiography, also called Coal Miner's Daughter, in 1976, and it was turned into a film in 1980, earning Sissy Spacek an Oscar for best actress. The musician's output slowed in the 1980s and she announced her retirement in the 1990s - although she still managed to release a handful of albums, including 1993's Honky Tonk Women, a collaboration with fellow country music trailblazers Dolly Parton and Tammy Wynette.  In the meantime, she turned her attention to food, launching a restaurant called Loretta Lynn's Kitchen, and a series of cookbooks that mixed recipes with stories from her life. She also opened the Loretta Lynn Ranch in Tennessee - Lynn's equivalent to Parton's Dollywood - which hosts a museum and campsite, and stages regular music events.  In 2004, her career was resurrected by super-fan Jack White, who encouraged her back into the studio for an album that combined his abrasive rock sound with Lynn's penchant for pedal steel and banjo. The album showed that her narrative power was undiminished (one song, Ms Leroy Brown, told of a bored housewife who stole her husband's savings to rent a limousine and go on a bender) and gained her a new audience at the age of 72, as well as the Grammy Award for best country album. In 2013, Lynn was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honour in the United States, by President Barack Obama. Later albums included Full Circle, a mix of new songs and remakes of old standards, and 2021's Still Woman Enough, which saw her duet with Margo Price and Tanya Tucker. Lynn stopped touring in 2017 after a stroke, and suffered a broken hip after falling over at home the following year. But she continued to perform and record, and forcefully denied tabloid reports at the time that her health was failing. ""Through the years they've said I'm broke, homeless, cheating, drinking, gone crazy, terminally ill, and even dead! Poor things can't ever get it right,"" she wrote on Facebook. ""I guess if those old pesky tabloids are harassing me then they're giving someone else a break... but I'm about an inch from taking 'em to Fist City!"" It was that down-to-earth gutsiness that endeared her to fans over the last six decades, and one that ensures her music still feels relevant. ""I like real life, because that's what we're doing today,"" she said 2004. ""And I think that's why people bought my records, because they're living in this world and so am I. So I see what's going on, and I grab it."" Lynn is survived by four of her six children: Clara, Ernest and twins Peggy and Patsy, as well as 17 grandchildren and four step-grandchildren.

"The Papers: 'Palace shock' at Harry interview, and Queen is 96","Thu, 21 Apr 2022 03:59:25 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-the-papers-61170793,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-the-papers-61170793?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Prince Harry's claims about protecting the Queen make several front pages.,"Under the headline ""Johnson seeks to delay vote on Partygate"", the Daily Telegraph reports on the latest move by Tory whips and ministers to head off a ballot on whether Prime Minister Boris Johnson misled parliament.  The Guardian claims Mr Johnson was forced to abandon plans to block the vote outright, in the face of a backbench mutiny.   Tory MPs have told the Times that the proposal to hold a vote after senior civil servant Sue Gray has published her report will be be enough to buy off most rebels - but could spell heightened danger for the PM if the Conservatives do badly in next month's local elections.   ""PM rigs rules to delay probe"" is the Daily Mirror's headline. It says it is a ""dark day' with the Tories set to ""dodge vote over Boris party lies"".   The prime minister will unveil investment deals worth more than a billion pounds in sectors including healthcare and software engineering on his trade mission to India, according to the Daily Express. Both the Times and the Mirror report that Mr Johnson has hinted at relaxing visa restrictions as part of a free trade agreement he hopes to announce by the end of the year. The Times says the prime minister will face a delicate balancing act attempting to woo the Indian government while encouraging it to move away from its its traditional support for Russia.    Sign up for a morning briefing direct to your inbox ""Children's tsar calls for ban on smacking"" is the lead story in the Times. It reports that the Children's Commissioner Rachel de Souza has said in an interview that she's supportive of extending a law restricting such physical discipline which currently only exists in Scotland and Wales, to England.  The paper quotes a government source as acknowledging the issue is ""polarising'"" but indicating there are no plans to change the law in England. Many front pages carry a new photo of the Queen, released to mark her 96th birthday. She's pictured smiling and holding the reins of two of her grey fell ponies.  But together with the universal birthday well-wishing, the headlines react to what many describe as Prince Harry's latest ""bombshell"" interview on American television.  ""Get orf your high horse Harry"" is the Sun's advice following claims from the Duke of Sussex that he was trying to ""protect"" the Queen, while the Daily Mail claims there was ""Palace shock at Harry: duke of delusion.""  The Express suggests he had delivered the ""ultimate royal snub"" by dithering over whether he would attend the Queen's jubilee next month and failing to answer a question over whether he missed his father and brother.  On its inside pages however, the paper turns to a happier subject, the special preparations being made for this year's derby at Epsom to mark the jubilee.  The Express says there'll be a guard of honour of royal jockeys and that it is hoped that one of three horses entered by the Queen, will break her ""derby duck"". The race remains the only one of five British horse-racing classics she hasn't won as an owner.

Mariupol hospital attack: Pregnant woman hurt in bombing gives birth,"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 22:16:48 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60715492,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60715492?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Mariana Vishegirskaya, a beauty blogger, has reportedly given birth to a baby girl.","A pregnant woman photographed escaping from the wreckage of a hospital bombed by Russia has given birth to a daughter, reports say. The image of heavily-pregnant Mariana Vishegirskaya, her face bloodied, descending rubble-strewn steps was widely shared amid outrage at the attack, which killed three people. She gave birth the following day, her niece in Turkey told local media. Ukraine's ambassador to the UN said the baby had been named Veronika. Sergiy Kyslytsya, who held up a picture of Ms Vishegirskaya and her newborn daughter during remarks at the UN, hit out at ""Russian lies"" about her in the aftermath of the attack. Ms Vishegirskaya became the subject of a Russian disinformation campaign after the bombing. The Russian embassy in the UK tweeted a conspiracy theory that Ms Vishegirskaya was an actress and the aftermath of the attack had been staged. However, the BBC's disinformation team found evidence which contradicted the unfounded claims, including that she had somehow pretended to be several women photographed at the scene. Twitter later removed the Russian embassy's tweets, saying they violated rules ""related to the denial of violent events"". Further claims circulating online suggested that Ms Vishegirskaya was not even pregnant. However, the beauty blogger revealed she was pregnant in January to her followers - weeks before the invasion - and later asked them if whether they thought she would have a girl or a boy.

""Miss Mariana, the pregnant woman gave birth to a healthy daughter last night. Her name is Veronika. Here she is with her father. No matter what the Russian lies are about herself, her family, and the incident,"" he said. He also said that more than 1,500 civilians had been killed by Russia in Mariupol, which has been without water or electricity for days after being surrounded by Russian forces and where several attempts to establish evacuation corridors had failed. Ukraine has said three people, including a child, had been killed in the hospital strike alone. ""For the first time since World War Two people are being buried in mass graves in Ukrainian cities,"" Mr Kyslytsya said. Numerous tech companies have begun blocking Russian state media channels in an attempt to tackle disinformation.

Ghana confirms first cases of deadly Marburg virus,"Sun, 17 Jul 2022 23:26:05 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-62202240,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-62202240?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Two patients in the West African nation have died recently of the Ebola-like virus, officials say.","Ghana has confirmed its first two cases of the deadly Marburg virus, a highly infectious disease in the same family as the virus that causes Ebola. It says both patients died recently in hospital in the southern Ashanti region. Their samples came back positive earlier this month and have now been verified by a laboratory in Senegal. Health officials in the West African nation say 98 people are now under quarantine as suspected contact cases. These include relatives, medics and mortuary workers who came into contact with the two patients. This is the second time that Marburg has been identified in West Africa. There was one confirmed case in Guinea last year, but that outbreak was declared over in September, five weeks after the case was discovered. The World Health Organization (WHO), which is supporting Ghana's health authorities, has praised the country's swift response. ""This is good because without immediate and decisive action, Marburg can easily get out of hand,"" said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO's Africa director. ""There's a whole multi-disciplinary team in the field trying to ensure that we are able to unearth the real source of this,"" Dr Patrick Kumah-Aboagye, the head of Ghana's health service told BBC Focus on Africa radio. Contact tracing and strict infection control measures have been introduced to prevent more fatalities. Teams are also going into communities to make them aware of the symptoms and to ensure they alert health authorities if any suspected cases emerge. No treatment yet exists for Marburg - but doctors say drinking plenty of water and treating specific symptoms improves a patient's chances of survival. The virus is transmitted to people from fruit bats and spreads between humans through the transmission of bodily fluids. Those at highest risk of getting infected include family members and hospital staff caring for someone who is sick. It is a severe, often fatal illness with symptoms including headache, fever, muscle pains, vomiting blood and bleeding.  Ghanaian officials are warning people to keep away from caves and to thoroughly cook all meat products before eating them.  Beyond West Africa, previous outbreaks and sporadic cases have been reported in Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, South Africa and Uganda, the WHO says.  The virus killed more than 200 people in Angola in 2005, the deadliest outbreak on record according to the global health body. The first ever Marburg outbreak was in Germany in 1967 where seven people died.

Mountain Rescuers called up Ben Nevis for struggling dog,"Sun, 14 Aug 2022 17:52:16 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-62542519,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-62542519?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Lochaber Mountain Rescue helped Turkish Mountain dog Maggie off the hill when she refused to budge.,"A mountain rescue team were called up the UK's highest mountain to bring back a dog that refused to budge. Maggie, a 35kg Turkish Akbash dog, had sore paws and refused to go further when the walkers she was with began their trek back down the hill. The three women attempted  to carry her but had to admit defeat. Lochaber Mountain Rescue got the pet back by 01:00 on Sunday, after a day that saw four other callouts. Team Leader Donald Paterson said conditions had taken their toll on the dog. He said: ""It had given up and the ladies were struggling to help it down. ""It had a few cuts to its paws, but I think with the heat and soreness it decided it wasn't going any further."" A stretcher party, complete with a casualty carer and chicken stick treats, was dispatched to assist Maggie.  The women managed to carry her halfway down Ben Nevis where they met the team. Maggie was secured to the stretcher and transported the rest of the way by the team in the dark. ""The owners were struggling and would certainly have been up there all night if they didn't get any assistance,"" said Mr Paterson. He said he would not expect his team to go out for an animal, but they insisted. The Lochaber team had been called out four times already - to assist someone with a head injury, another with an ankle injury and two cases related to the hot conditions. They finally finished their shift after the five-hour rescue at 01:00.

"Many skip work over hygiene poverty shame, charity says","Wed, 26 Oct 2022 23:49:05 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-63403823,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-63403823?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Some 3.2m adults struggle to afford basic hygiene products leading to shame and exclusion, charity says.","People's inability to afford essential hygiene products is leaving many too ashamed to go to work, a charity says.  A report suggests 3.2 million UK adults are affected by so-called hygiene poverty - with 12% saying they have avoided facing colleagues as a result.  Their struggle to buy basic items such as soap and deodorant is having a devastating effect on their daily lives, it says. Hygiene Bank chief executive Ruth Brock said it was a ""hidden crisis"". ""It's much more widespread than we feared, it's increasing, and it's disproportionately impacting the most vulnerable,"" she said.  Hygiene Bank works to supply food banks, homeless shelters, schools, and other organisations with items including toothpaste, shampoo, soap, deodorant, nappies, period products and laundry detergent.  The charity began in 2018 after founder Lizzy Hall saw the Ken Loach-directed film I, Daniel Blake, which features a scene where a struggling single mother is caught shoplifting sanitary products.  ""I think it just doesn't occur to people in the same way that fuel and food poverty do,"" said Ms Brock.  ""But the truth is by the time you're not switching on your heating or you're going to a food bank for food essentials, you've stopped buying essential hygiene products weeks before."" The charity says a survey it carried out with nearly 2,200 people, in partnership with polling company YouGov, suggests the numbers impacted by hygiene poverty equated to 6% of all UK adults, rising to 13% from lower-income households and 21% of disabled people.  Those experiencing hygiene poverty were most likely to go without shaving products, laundry detergent, household cleaning items, and deodorant, the survey found. A quarter of respondents said they had gone without toilet paper or soap or shower gel, while three in ten women did not buy period products.  Speaking to the BBC, one woman who did not want to be named, said the only supermarket she has within walking distance has removed its own-brand sanitary products - meaning that she is either having to pay ""many times more"" for premium products or is having to go without as she can't afford to travel to a shop further away. Another woman the charity has worked with, a single mum-of-two named Elaine, described diluting products to make them last longer and tying up her hair in a certain way to hide the fact she often had not washed it for weeks at a time.  She also suffers bouts of acne from being unable to wash her face and feels the need to keep a distance from people for fear that she smells.  Another person said an inability to keep themselves clean had impacted their confidence so much they had begun avoiding social contact, including by not answering their phone. Hygiene Bank's Ruth Brock said that such accounts may ""seem counterintuitive"" to some people, and added: ""But it's so insidious, you kind of cut yourself off."" The report found that 62% of people experiencing hygiene poverty with dependent children said they have had to choose between buying products for themselves or their children.  ""Let's face it, who's going to come first in that scenario?"" said Ms Brock.  ""This is why we have mums telling us about being ashamed to leave the house and not seeing anyone for weeks on end. And mums telling us that they want to be last at the nursery drop off. Because they're too embarrassed and ashamed to see other parents."" She said Hygiene Bank was able to give the children of one family their own toothbrushes for the first time, and they were so happy they had taken them to bed as if they were new toys. The data in the report draws on surveys conducted between October 2021 and February 2022, before the recent surge in the cost of living, meaning the pressures described are now likely to be even worse, says the charity. Data from the Office for National Statistics shows that the price of shampoo has increased by 8% just in the last year, while shower gel is up by 11%. The price of toothpaste has risen 6%, and the price of deodorant is up 5%. One student, named as Adam, was a college student whose attendance had fallen to 18%, in part because he could not afford basic hygiene products, and whose grades were suffering as a result.  His support worker approached Hygiene Bank in the summer of 2020 and they were able to provide deodorant and shampoo. Adam's attendance rose to 100%, and he is now attending university.  ""Hygiene is important enough,"" says Ms Brock. ""But the follow-on effects of making that change for people also mean that they can then start to access their life chances.""
