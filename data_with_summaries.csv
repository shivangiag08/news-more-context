""in these forests, mammals perform lots of important roles that help maintain the ecosystem, such as dispersing seeds, moving nutrients through the ecosystem and controlling the populations of other species through herbivory and predation.""gorczynski said the hololens is easy to learn to use. he has taught several scientists, technicians and students in tanzania and madagascar to incorporate it in theirdata collection, and he is already imagining potential collaborations where the standardized, scalable data accumulated through a hololens could be used in tandem across multiple sites.""dan knew he wanted to study mammal functional diversity and hit the ground running when he joined my lab,"" beaudrot said.

animals with more fat reserves may be able to travel longer distances. or could it be how a species reproduces and survives? for example, animals that lay many eggs or mature early may be more likely to establish a new population in a new place.but despite a vigorous theoretical debate, the options to test these hypotheses were limited because such dispersal events are rare. also, the right statistical tools were not available until recently.thanks to the recent development of newbiogeographical modelsand the great availability of data, we can now try to answer questions about how tetrapod species (amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals) have moved around the globe over the past 300 million years and whether successful species share any common characteristics.these models allow us to estimate the movements of species' ancestors while also considering their characteristics. we used these models to study 7,009 species belonging to 56 groups of tetrapods.what we foundfor 91% of theanimal groupswe studied, models that included species characteristics were better supported than models that didn't. this means that body size and life history are closely linked to how successful a species is at moving to and establishing itself in a new location.animals withlarge bodiesand fast life histories (breeding early and often, like water voles) generally dispersed more successfully, as expected. however, there were some exceptions to this rule. in some groups, smaller animals or animals with average traits had higher dispersal rates.for example, small hummingbirds dispersed better than larger ones, and poison dart frogs with intermediate life histories dispersed better than those with very fast or very slow life histories.we investigated this variation further and found that the relationship between body size and movement depended on the average size and life history of the group. our results show that the links between characteristics and dispersal success depend on both body size and lifehistory, and that these cannot be considered separately.groups in whichsmall sizewas an advantage were often already made up of small species (making the dispersal-prone species even smaller), and these species also had fast life histories. we found this to be true for the rodent familiesmuridaeandcricetidae.but groups in which dispersers had intermediate body sizes generally had slow life histories (meaning they had low reproductive output but long lifespans). this means the combination of small body size and slowlife historyis very unlikely to be an advantage for dispersal across major barriers such as oceans.it's not just chanceit is amazing to think that rare dispersal events, which can lead to the rise of many new species, are not completely random. instead, the intrinsic characteristics of species can shape the histories of entire groups of animals, even though chance still may play an important role.at the same time, two of the most importantenvironmental challengesof our time are related to movement across major barriers: biological invasions andspecies' responses to climate change. on a planet facing rapid changes, understanding howanimalsmove across barriers is therefore crucial.",Neutral,"Animal characteristics, such as body size and life history, influence their ability to disperse across major barriers like oceans. Larger animals with faster life histories generally disperse more successfully, but exceptions exist.

is working to keep children learning in burkina faso, where 6,149 — one in four — schools remain shut due to ongoing violence and insecurity. every girl has the right to an education and to make decisions about her own future. adolescent girls around the world are raising their voices and leading the shift toward a more egalitarian world. yet while girls are willing to help shape our collective future, a web of concurrent, interrelated crises and barriers stand in their way. unicef-supported programs around the world are helping to end child marriage, keep girls in school and protect girls' mental and physical well-being. these efforts highlight the importance of investing in girls, while underscoring the urgent need for greater financial commitments to protect and promote girls' rights. on sept. 21, 2023, adolescent girls attend an event sponsored by the unfpa-unicef global program to end child marriage in monapo district, nampula province, mozambique. the initiative emphasizes community engagement, enhances girls' access to quality education and health services, which empowers them with information and skills, and offers alternatives to early marriage through the creation of livelihood opportunities.  preventing girls from marrying early protects them from abuse and helps them reach their full potential girls who marry before the age of 18 are not only denied a childhood, they are also often socially isolated, with limited opportunities for education and employment, preventing them from reaching their full potential. unicef works around the world with a range of stakeholders to change attitudes about child marriage and to empower girls who are at risk of being married or are already in union. since 2016, the global program to end child marriage, a joint initiative of unicef and unfpa, the united nations population fund, has reached more than 21 million adolescent girls with life-skills training, comprehensive sexuality education and school

(gross domestic product). helping girls finish high school can boost a country's gdp by 10 percent by 2030 on average, an educated girl will earn twice as much over her lifetime as a girl with no schooling. globally, almost twice as many adolescent girls as boys are not in any form of education, employment or training. recent research estimates that investments of just $1.53 per day per girl can boost the number of girls who complete high school, helping developing economies to expand their gdp (gross domestic product) by an average of 10 percent by the year 2030. on sept. 9, 2023, on the

trees. often used as a method to capture and store carbon, trees are a scalable and cost-effective tool in the fight against climate change. researchers have repeatedly lauded trees as a solution to tackling the climate crisis. in one study, scientists estimated that new forests could capture two-thirds of all human carbon emissions. and the power of a tree doesn’t stop there. trees can also advance biodiversity, reduce life-threatening heat, filter air pollution and improve the mental and physical health of the people living near them. though rooted in a single spot, the impact of a tree reaches much further. by helping to plant trees in the right place and at the right time, companies can maximize the potential of their investment to yield the most benefits for the climate and the world. trees also help bring people together. planting trees is a unifying, impartial act, devoid of prejudice and politics. they are a meaningful contribution to the health of future generations and an honest indication of hope. whether it’s through urban forestry in massive city centers or reforestation in a faraway forest, trees add value. there are tangible, unignorable results tied to tree planting. this is not a “greenwashing” promise. companies that choose to support tree planting can witness the living proof of the real impact they’re making. for someone who believes that their company values and sustainability objectives align with tree planting, it’s crucial to start the process with a sense of intention. you know you want to plant trees. now, the next step is to ask: what do you hope to achieve with those trees? are you striving to foster critical wildlife habitat, assist in reforesting scorched land after a wildfire, reduce life-threatening heat in underserved communities or something else entirely? the most successful tree-planting projects are focused on the desired outcome right from the very beginning. at times, private sector leaders eager to boast big pledges may focus too much on the number of trees planted rather than the positive impact those trees can bring. while we do need millions and millions of more trees, to fully realize the power of those trees we must consider where to plant them and how they’ll positively impact communities and the environment. sometimes, companies know exactly where and how they want to use trees to make a difference. sometimes, they have no idea where to start. and that is perfectly okay. i urge private sector leaders to remember they don’t have to know exactly how to make it happen. forestry is a team sport. corporate leaders should seek out conservationists and foresters to help guide them on where they can make the most impact. companies should also look to each other. for those new to tree planting, it’s advisable to engage in knowledge-sharing sessions with like-minded corporate peers. these conversations can assist in identifying the most impactful way for you to participate in tree planting. over time, you will be able to carve out a clearer sense of purpose behind your desire to plant trees. eventually, you'll be able to progress from “i want to plant trees” to “i want to plant trees in an international forest” to “i want to plant trees in madagascar to help preserve critical habitat for endangered lemurs.” there are endless directions to take in a corporation's journey, and no matter the path selected, defining the objective is a key part of establishing a legacy of impact. because then, the work is not just about planting trees in the ground; it's about using trees as a vehicle for change. forbes nonprofit council is an invitation-only organization for chief executives in successful nonprofit organizations. do i qualify?",Neutral,"Private sector leaders are increasingly embracing nature-based solutions to combat climate change, with trees emerging as a scalable and cost-effective tool.

louis, mauritius– until early 2022, gaetan (real name withheld) was earning a decent living as a construction worker, helping on sites around mauritius, when he made a snap decision that would turn his life upside down. while smoking a cigarette with colleagues during his lunch break one day, the 35-year-old was offered the opportunity to buy some heroin. within weeks, he was taking it daily to stave off the aches and pains of withdrawal. “that one decision cost me dearly,” he tells al jazeera. soon he was dipping into his hard-earned savings to find the 2,000 mauritian rupees ($45) he needed for his four daily doses. his fellow addicts at work would strip copper wires or lift corrugated iron and white goods off the streets, selling the metal to fund their habit  – a common practice in the city. in the grip of addiction for a few months, gaetan realised he had to get out fast. but after two weeks of quitting drug use, he relapsed. eventually, he found his way to the idrice goomany treatment centre, located in the heart of port louis, where he completed an intensive six-month detox programme. he still visits weekly for counseling and is a rare success story on this tiny island of 1.3 million people being ravaged by a drug epidemic of unprecedented proportions. heroin addiction, which peaked in the ‘90s, has made a roaring comeback in the country, the drug rerouted to its shores through madagascar on its journey from afghanistan to east and southern africa. in parallel, synthetics have taken hold – drugs like “black mamba”, “rambo” and “murder” made with chemicals from china, which are mixed with thinner or pesticides and sprayed onto tea, tobacco or herbs, providing highly toxic hits to youngsters. “the advantage of synthetics is that they are cheap,” says imran dhanoo, director of the centre. schoolkids club together to buy a hit for 100 mauritian rupees ($2), he says. “today, drugs are the country’s number one problem,” says mario ah-sian, director of the centre d’accueil de terre rouge, another treatment centre located a few kilometres from port louis. the 63-year-old quit heroin 23 years ago and has since devoted his life to helping others free themselves from the affliction. drugs have wreaked havoc all over the island, sparking a wave of robberies and assaults, he says. according to a 2021 official survey, around 55,000 people between the ages of 18 and 59 (7.4 percent of that tranche of the population) consume non-injectable drugs, including cannabis, synthetics and heroin ingested by sniffing, snorting or smoking. calculations were based on small samples rather than boots-on-the-ground fieldwork, says ah-sian. like many others al jazeera spoke to, he believes the real figures are much higher. in karo kalyptus, the impact of the fast-growing drugs trade is easy to see. this is the epicentre of the island’s narco scene, an area targeted last july in a meticulously-planned police raid that hauled 77 million mauritian rupees (more than $1.7m) worth of cannabis, synthetics and heroin. looking around the tiny enclave, a ramshackle cluster of raw concrete and rusting corrugated iron shacks deep within the impoverished suburb of roche bois, it’s hard to believe such large sums transit through here. al jazeera met three local women in karo kalyptus. they spoke using pseudonyms while stressing that they were sick of seeing their young being destroyed by drugs. life here is tough, says marie, who washes clothes for a living and notes that many kids don’t go to school, some starting on drugs as early as age 10. “ena zanfan inn fini andan,” she says, in creole – “there are kids whose insides are destroyed”. earlier this year, she stumbled upon a dead man on the street, whom she believes overdosed on heroin. claudine, another one of the women, says crystal meth and a new product called “ladrog zombi” (“zombie drug”), which renders users comatose, are becoming more prevalent on the market. the name of the latter drug and the description of its effects appear to tally with recent reports of animal tranquilliser xylazine arriving in neighbouring reunion. locals here are employed as lookouts. they earn 1,500-2,000 rupees ($34-45) per day, a relatively lucrative pay packet in a country where many struggle on a minimum wage of 15,000 rupees ($340) a month in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis.  often, lookouts receive advance notice of police visits, sometimes as long as two hours. “someone on the inside is giving them the information,” says claudine. in 2018, a state-appointed commission of inquiry found clear evidence of mafia influence over a variety of actors, including police, prison guards, lawyers, customs officials and politicians. it advised that the country’s anti drug and smuggling unit (adsu), judged too rotten to reform, be dismantled. five years later, adsu lives on, its influence bolstered by the creation of a complementary force called the special striking team (sst) made up of former officers from adsu ranks. as next year’s election slides into view, the government of prime minister pravind jugnauth has stepped up its war on drugs with sombre billboards announcing “unis contre la drogue – united against drugs”. but, critics claim the sst is a political tool of jugnauth’s militant socialist movement (msm), calling his sincerity into question. officers have arrested high-profile targets, including lawyer akil bissessur and activist bruneau laurette,known for advocacy against police brutality and narco influence,on provisional charges of drug trafficking or fraud. the government also stands accused of protecting the island’s biggest trafficker. jean-hubert célerine, aka franklin, was sentenced to seven years in prison for inter-island trafficking by authorities in neighbouring reunion in 2021. yet he remains in mauritius, where he is currently being investigated for money laundering. so low is public trust in the government that many suspect the probe was set up to delay the kingpin’s extradition. “if he talks, a lot of senior heads will roll,” says ally lazer, a veteran social worker, who has waged a decades-long campaign against drugs on the island. “there’s no political will to fight the drugs mafia,” says nando bodha, former secretary-general of the ruling msm, who left the party after witnessing its lurch towards autocracy close up. now with linion moris, a multi-party alliance, he wants to overhaul a system he believes is corruption-ridden. “more and more, we’re turning into a narco economy,” he says. “drug money is involved in horse racing, betting, casinos and retail businesses. kingpins have infiltrated the judicial and legal systems”. al jazeera contacted the government information service for an interview, but got no response.      as drugs become more enmeshed in the fabric of daily life, the country is reviewing its treatment of addicts, moving away from the repressive policies of old. right now, the government is setting up a panel to shepherd users through the various stages of recovery – from rehabilitation to reintegration. it’s a move welcomed by dhanoo who wants to see more addicts in treatment centres, rather than in prison. but, until narco influence is tackled, the problem won’t be going away any time soon. gaetan recalls how easy it was to dodge adsu officers in baie du tombeau when he was out buying doses of “brown”, as heroin is known locally. “there were about four of five dealers in the area. everyone knew where the police was,” he says. slowly, he is recovering. in his village of flacq, where “most people are on something, young, old, men, women”, he has cut off contact with former associates and only leaves his home to go to work or buy food, always ensuring he only carries a strict minimum of cash. “i feel like before i started taking it, but i know i’ve changed,” gaetan says. “it’s a curse. it finishes you off.”          follow al jazeera english:",Negative,"Mauritius faces a severe drug epidemic, with heroin and synthetic drugs like ""black mamba"" prevalent. The government has launched a ""war on drugs,"" but critics question its sincerity and accuse it of protecting traffickers. Despite efforts to establish treatment programs, the problem persists due to widespread narco influence in the country's systems."

 China will bring in requirements for export permits for some graphite products in an effort to protect… [+4606 chars]",Madagascar,"china will bring in requirements for export permits for some graphite products in an effort to protect its national security, said the country's commerce ministry on friday.  the announcement comes at a time when foreign governments are increasing their pressure on chinese companies over their industrial practices. china is the world's top graphite producer and exporter and also refines more than 90% of the world's graphite into the material, which is used in virtually all ev battery anodes - the negatively charged portion of a battery. under the new restrictions, china will require as of 1 december that exporters apply for permits to be able to ship two types of graphite, including high-purity, high-hardness and high-intensity synthetic graphite material, and natural flake graphite and its products. meanwhile, it dropped temporary controls on five less sensitive graphite items used in basic industries such as steel, metallurgy, and chemicals. ""the new measures will ensure the domestic supply of graphite for military use, such as in the aerospace sector, as well as domestic battery-making,"" chang ke, an analyst at consultancy mysteel, told reuters. why graphite is important for the global economy natural graphite is classified as a critical raw material (crm) by the eu, japan, canada and the us. according to the international energy agency, graphite demand is expected to rise by 20-25 times in the 2020-40 period. ""high-sensitivity graphite is a high-performance material with a wide range of applications in industries such as semiconductors, automobiles, aerospace, battery manufacturing, and chemicals,"" ivan lam, senior analyst at counterpoint research, told reuters. however, many countries across the globe, europe included, are relying on imports to meet their graphite demands.  top buyers of graphite from china include japan, the united states, india and south korea, according to chinese customs data. is the move part of a trade war? china's latest move to control supplies appears to be a response to an escalating trade war between the asian country and the us, as well as the eu.  the announcement came mere  days after the us tightened controls on exports of semiconductors to china , including stopping sales of more advanced artificial intelligence chips made by nvidia. meanwhile, the european union is weighing levying tariffs on chinese-made evs, arguing they unfairly benefit from subsidies. the new curb on graphite exports is similar to  those in place since 1 august for two chip-making metals, gallium and germanium.  the restrictions have slashed exports of those metals from china recently and pushed up prices outside the country. ""it would be a bold step to cut off the world from graphite because i think the chinese know that would bring evs to a halt everywhere and probably would create escalation rather than de-escalation of some of the trade disputes going on with china - between the eu and china, between the us and china,"" said christopher richter, deputy head of research at clsa in tokyo, japan.  prices are likely to rise while policymakers appear to weaponise their natural resources and products, the rising sale of  electric vehicles  is making automakers race to lock in supplies from outside china, to avoid upset supply chains, increased costs and disrupted production. however, analysts said it is still unclear how far china would take this graphite export curb and how much impact the new measures on graphite will have in the short term. however, it appears likely that prices will be impacted. ""graphite has a wide range of applications in industry, and the demand for its use is growing,"" ivan lam told reuters. ""we believe that the average price of graphite will continue to rise in the future due to supply and demand imbalances, including russia, which was one of the major graphite suppliers before the russia-ukraine war."" richter said it is also likely that manufacturers are diversifying their supply chains, including ""looking for alternative sources as well as alternative materials"".  where else is good for graphite? china produces two-thirds of the world’s graphite, but compared to global reserves, the asian country is not the only option. according to the united states geological survey , turkey (27.3%) and brazil (22.4%) together own half of the world's natural graphite resources.  china comes third, sitting on 16%, followed by madagascar (7.9%), mozambique (7.6%), tanzania (5.5%) and russia with more than 4%. the move could hit the us economy particularly hard as one-third of its graphite imports come from china. and it has  few close allies  among  the alternative countries  at the moment. ",Neutral,"China will implement export permit requirements for certain graphite products to safeguard national security. The move comes amid international pressure on Chinese industrial practices.

ceremonial grade, which is produced from young tea leaves, is typically the best grade of matcha available. it has a delicate and nuanced flavor that’s meant to be enjoyed in a traditional manner: by whisking it with water. how do you choose matcha powder? it all depends on what you’ll be doing with the matcha powder. if you plan on combining it with other ingredients or adding it to baked goods, then go for a culinary grade matcha, which can hold up to additional flavors. ceremonial grade matcha is meant to be sipped as is, but park uses them for lattes, too. “though it is often said that culinary matcha is best suited for lattes, i find that a higher grade of matcha is better to use so that you don't end up with a latte that tastes like an earthy glass of oat milk,” she says. domatcha ceo john harrison also has this tip: “if you do some extra digging, you can find out which supplier the brand sources its tea leaves and matcha from. choose a supplier that already has a longstanding and good reputation in japan.” how can you tell if matcha is high quality? as a general rule of thumb, the more vibrant green a matcha is, the higher the quality. good matcha powders will also be very finely ground and give off a grassy, not musty, aroma. when it comes to flavor, it shouldn’t be astringent or bitter, but has a smooth, mild earthiness.",Positive,"Matcha, a Japanese green tea powder, has gained popularity for its health benefits and versatility. It comes in two main grades: culinary and ceremonial. Culinary grade is suitable for cooking and baking, while ceremonial grade is meant for traditional tea ceremonies.

""in many cases these changes are happening too quickly for them to adapt,"" said kelsey neam, of the amphibian specialist group at the international union for conservation of nature's (iucn) species survival commission. ""climate change is an underestimated threat to amphibians"" and will become ""more evident"" as more data emerges going forward, she added, predicting ""an exponential effect"". ""we expect climate change to push species closer to extinction,"" neam told afp. a landmark 2004 study, the global amphibian assessment, showed amphibians were the world's most threatened vertebrates. in a paper published in the journal nature on wednesday, researchers built on a second such study published last year that evaluated 8,011 species for the iucn red list. they found almost 41 percent of amphibians were globally threatened, defined as appearing under the list's ""critically endangered"", ""endangered"" and ""vulnerable"" categories. that represented a deterioration from 37.9 percent in 1980 and 39.4 percent in 2004. climate change was the main driver of 39 percent of status declines from 2004 to 2022, affecting 119 species, with habitat loss and degradation at 37 percent. climate change can also exacerbate other threats such as fires, disease and land use change, the authors noted. habitat loss and damage linked to agriculture, infrastructure development and other industries remained the most common threat but did not primarily drive as many status deteriorations. in contrast, habitat loss and disease -- especially the chytrid fungus, which devastated amphibians worldwide starting in the late 1990s -- were responsible for 91 percent of status deteriorations between 1980 and 2004, with just one percent primarily due to climate change. threatened species were concentrated most in caribbean islands, mesoamerica, the tropical andes, cameroon, nigeria, madagascar, india's western ghats mountain range and sri lanka. salamanders and newts were the most affected species. for example, five us salamander species have experienced status declines due to fires and less humid soils caused by droughts and wildfires that scientists say climate change has exacerbated. in parts of australia and brazil, reduced rainfall linked to climate change is predicted to threaten the reproduction of frogs that depend on high levels of moisture in the soil and fallen leaves to prevent their eggs drying up. the authors called for greater investment and policy responses to support amphibians, which play a key role in ecosystems and can help fight climate change. they are prey for mammals, birds and reptiles, contribute to recycling nutrients and help sustain the food web, which would collapse without them, said neam, who highlighted the urgency of protecting habitats and slashing carbon emissions. ""by protecting amphibians, we are protecting the forests and ecosystems that are key, nature-based solutions to battling climate change,"" she told afp. ""an investment in amphibians is an investment in the future of our planet."" amphibians' small distribution often makes them more vulnerable to extinction than other vertebrates, but that can also facilitate conservation efforts, said study co-author jennifer luedtke, of the iucn's amphibian specialist group. improved habitat protection and management played major roles in species who improved their category between 2004 and 2022, neam added.",Negative,"Climate change is the primary threat to amphibians, driving 39% of population declines since 2004. Habitat loss and degradation remain significant threats, but climate change exacerbates these and other factors. Amphibians are particularly vulnerable due to their reliance on moisture and lack of protective coverings. The Caribbean, Mesoamerica, and the Andes are hotspots for threatened species, with salamanders and newts being the most affected.

precedes even biblical times. the area in question covers a tiny swathe of the southern levant, bordering lebanon, syria, jordan, egypt and the mediterranean sea. with perpetually shifting borders, accusations of segregation and claims of historical significance, the region has served as a fierce battleground between jews, arabs, and palestinians, backed by a rotating cast of states including the uk, america, france, iran, and turkey. while 165 member states of the united nations refer to the region as israel, the remaining 30 do not recognise israeli statehood and refer to the land as palestine. of the states that recognise israel, all accept that the jewish settlements and segregationist policies constitute a form of forced occupation. at present, most of the west bank is administered by israel although approximately 42 per cent of it is under various degrees of autonomous rule by the palestinian authority. the gaza strip, a 41-kilometre-long and 10-kilometre-wide strip of land located between egypt and the mediterranean sea, is currently under the control of hamas which is designated as a terrorist organisation by the united states and european union. although many consider the conflict between israel and palestine to be one of territory not religion, it is impossible to understand the historical significance of israel without touching upon its importance to judaism and islam. jerusalem, one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world, is considered holy to the three major abrahamic religions of islam, christianity, and judaism. it features prominently in the hebrew bible. in jewish tradition, it represents the place where abraham, the first patriarch of judaism, nearly sacrificed his son to god thousands of years ago. it was the capital of king david’s israel in the hebrew bible, as well as the site where david’s son solomon built his temple. in biblical times, people who could not make a pilgrimage to jerusalem were instructed to pray in its direction, and even today, most synagogues are oriented towards it. similarly, according to the quran, prophet muhammad ascended to the heavens from jerusalem. it is home to several islamic landmarks, including the al-aqsa mosque and the dome of the rock. according to the late arthur hertzberg, a prominent jewish scholar, while jerusalem is significant to islam, the palestinian claim to the land is based more on history than religion. ina small peace for the middle east,hertzbergwritesthat for the jews, israel was a place where they could find “peace and acceptance in the land where their ancestors had once fashioned their religion and culture.” whereas, the palestinians have “no corresponding messianic vision” wanting simply to “be left alone in the land they believe was taken from them in wars of conquest.” the characterisation of israel as the jewish holy land on one side and the historic land of the arabs on the other, has dominated the narrative since the late 19th century. in reality, both jews and muslims have claims to the land of israel although the latter have governed the land for far longer. since antiquity, the southern levant has been ruled by a myriad of empires including the assyrians, babylonians, persians, greeks, romans, byzantines, and ottomans. israel first emerged as a term used to describe people that descended from the semitic canaanites. as those people slowly settled and won kingdoms of their own they began to dominate large parts of what we now consider the state of israel. according to archaeological research, evidence of the israeli people occupying what is now northern israel (kingdom of israel) and southern israel (judah) dates back to the ninth century bce. around the same time, it is believed that the philistines (from which palestine is derived) occupied israel’s southern coastal plain. in around 722 bce, the neo-assyrians conquered the lands of the kingdom of israel and judah, thus erasing the term ‘israel’ from the geographic map. from around the fifth century bce to 135 ad, the former kingdom of judah served as the base of judaism but that changed when the roman emperor hadrian expelled the jews and decreed that the city and its surrounding areas be referred to as “syria palaestina”. arabs started to settle in palestine after the islamic conquest of the middle east in the seventh century. apart from 90 years during which the crusaders held the region, muslims held the area for 1,200 years. particularly important amongst the powers that controlled israel was the ottoman period reigning from 1516-1917. accordingto mutaz m qafisheh, a professor of international law at hebron university, during ottoman rule, inhabitants of israel were considered ottoman citizens. ingenesis of citizenship in palestine and israel, he writes that “at that time, legally speaking, there was nothing called palestine, palestinian nationality, or palestinians, neither was there anything called israel, israeli nationality, or israelis.” although there were occasional tensions between the jews and their arab rulers, the region’s jewish community largely lived in peace with its muslim and catholic occupants. however, that peace would be upended by european mismanagement and the rise of the zionist movement. in response to the rising hatred towards jews in europe and russia in the second half of the 19th century, the zionist movement was formed in the hope of establishing a national homeland for the jewish diaspora. inspired by the austro-hungarian activist theodor herzl, zionists advocated for the immigration of jews to israel. the movement was met with considerable support from rich jewish businessmen and large parts of the european political machinery. chief amongst the supporters of the zionist movement were leading british politicians of the time. in 1915, the british promised the sharif of mecca an independent arab state including palestine and in exchange, the arab forces would revolt against the ottoman empire. two years later, british foreign minister arthur balfour reversed course, issuing a declaration in support of establishing a national home for the jews in the territory of palestine. however, unbeknownst to both the arabs and the jews, france and great britain had already divided the ottoman provinces between themselves in the covert 1916 sykes-picot agreement. in the aftermath of the first world war, the league of nations granted britain the right to administer parts of the former ottoman empire including palestine. from 1922-1947, the area would therefore be known as british mandate palestine, its stated goal being to establish a homeland for the jews while protecting the rights of the arab majority. initially, britain imposed restrictions on jewish immigration to palestine, setting quotas and requiring jews to purchase land in exchange for migration rights. after the nazis began persecuting jews in 1933, the international community was suddenly pressured by the zionists to settle the question of the jewish homeland. at the evian conference of 1938, attempts were made to delineate an independent territory for the jewish refugees, with madagascar, british guiana, alaska, and santo domingo proposed as potential options. no consensus was reached however, and a little less than a year later, the british introduced the white paper of 1939, announcing that british palestine would be turned into an independent binational state with an arab majority, with provisions to protect the rights of the jewish minority. after the end of the war, the tide shifted once again. confronted by the atrocities committed against the jews during the holocaust, british politicians proposed a division of british palestine between the arabs and the jews. justifying the right of the british to transfer those lands, in 1942, chaim weizmann, a leading zionist, wrote in a much publicised essay that “whatever the arabs gained — and it was a great deal — as a result of the last war; whatever they may gain — and they have already gained something, and will gain more — as a result of this one, they owe, and will owe, entirely to the democracies. it is therefore for the democracies to proclaim the justice of the jewish claim to their own commonwealth in palestine.” in 1947, the un passed resolution 181, partitioning british palestine into “independent arab and jewish states.” at the time, jews owned around 6 per cent of the land in british palestine and comprised of 33 percent of palestine’s population. under the un partition, the jews would get 56 per cent of the land to form the state of israel. they were content. the arab countries were enraged. arab-israeli conflict on may 14, 1948, israel’s founding father, david ben-gurion, declared the establishment of the modern state of israel. along with palestinian forces, the militaries of several arab nations invaded the newly formed jewish state almost immediately. backed even then by the massive coffers of the united states, israel was prepared to defend itself. approximately 700,000 palestinians, or half of the arab inhabitants of what was british-ruled palestine, were forced to flee their homes during the ensuing conflict and ended up in gaza, the west bank, jordan, and syria. the war of independence, as it was known to the jews, or the nakba (catastrophe), as it was known to the arabs, created armistice lines along israel’s frontiers with “neighbouring states, including the boundaries of what became known as the gaza strip (occupied by egypt) and east jerusalem and the west bank (occupied by jordan). in october 1956, israel, backed by france and the uk, further expanded its territorial gains by capturing the sinai peninsula from egypt during the suez crisis.this, combined with growing tensions between arab states and israel, led to the six-day war (june 5, 1967 – june 10, 1967). the war was fought between israel and a coalition of arab states (egypt, syria and jordan). although the arab states had a strong advantage in terms of numbers, the israelis were better funded and more organised, resulting in a comprehensive victory that left israel in occupation of the sinai peninsula, the gaza strip, the west bank, east jerusalem and most of the syrian golan heights. this in turn effectively tripled the size of territory under israel’s control. as the israeli author avner cohen wrote for the wilson centre, the six-day war “transformed israel from a nation that perceived itself as fighting for survival into an occupier and regional powerhouse.” led by egypt and syria, the arab states attacked israel once again in 1973 but the ensuing yom kippur war ended in another victory for the israelis, albeit one without any territorial gains. despite over two decades of conflict with israel, in 1979, egypt became the first arab country to recognise the jewish state in exchange for israel withdrawing its forces and settlers from the sinai. this exchange proved catastrophic for the palestinians, with mounin rabbani, of the international crisis group, stating in aninterviewwith brookings that, without the influence of a potential egyptian-israeli confrontation, palestinians lost the main element of their diplomatic leverage. thereafter, the conflict shifted from being one between israel and the arab world, to one between israel and palestine. israel-palestine conflict from the late 1970s, israel began establishing settlements in the west bank and gaza. described by amnesty international as a “mass human rights violation,” over the last 50 years, the government of israel has defended its expansion of settlements on occupied palestinian land as being integral to its national security. however, in 1977, then israeli prime minister, menachem begin, made it clear that the settlements had more to do with the ideological belief that the land belonged to israel than it did with any notions of security. by 1987, palestinians, increasingly frustrated by israel’s settlement policies of segregation, launched the first intifada (uprising,) and a year later, the plo issued a statement from algerian exile, in which it proclaimed the establishment of an independent palestinian state. the first intifada failed to bring palestinians the state they so desperately hoped but also failed to bring israel the legitimacy it craved. it was during this time that hamas or the islamic resistance movement, was formed. in the hopes of negotiating a peace agreement between the warring factions, then us president bill clinton launched a diplomatic initiative that would come to be known as the oslo accords. signed in 1993 and 1995, the oslo accords was seen as a potential resolution to decades of conflict. under it, the plo recognised israel’s right to exist and israel accepted the plo as the legitimate representative of the palestinian people. moreover, the agreement brought the occupied west bank and gaza under a new legal regime. however, optimism was short-lived, as the second intifada erupted in 2000, shattering the oslo accords’ promise of lasting peace. this violent, four-year uprising was marked by bombings, suicide attacks, and a heavy israeli military response, causing immense suffering on both sides. as the conflict worsened, the political cracks between hamas and the plo began to emerge. in 2007, hamas took control of gaza while the plo held the west bank. this political bifurcation of the west bank and gaza proved to be widely unpopular with a june 2023 survey by the palestinian center for policy and survey research finding that one-third of palestinians consider the rift to be the most damaging development for their people since the state of israel’s creation in 1948. since the split, the plo and hamas have alternated between animosity and reluctant benevolence but despite the friction, the plo has backed the right of hamas to defend gaza from israeli occupation. in tracing the complex evolution of the borders between israel and palestine, it becomes evident that this enduring conflict is rooted in a deeply intricate tapestry of politics, religion, and territorial claims. the significance of the land in question, including the territories known as the west bank and gaza strip, transcends generations, serving as a perpetual battleground for a multitude of stakeholders.",Negative,"The Israel-Palestine conflict, rooted in historical and religious significance, has been ongoing for nearly a century. The region, covering a small area in the southern Levant, has been a battleground for Jews, Arabs, and Palestinians, with shifting borders and accusations of segregation. While 165 UN member states recognize Israel, 30 do not, referring to the land as Palestine. Israel controls most of the West Bank, while Hamas governs the Gaza Strip. Jerusalem, considered holy by Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, is a focal point of the conflict. The characterization of Israel as a Jewish holy land and Palestine as an Arab historic land has dominated the narrative since the late 19th century. The conflict has been influenced by European mismanagement, the rise of Zionism, and the Holocaust. The 1947 UN resolution partitioned British Palestine into Arab and Jewish states, leading to the establishment of Israel and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. Subsequent wars and peace initiatives have failed to resolve the conflict, which remains a complex interplay of politics, religion, and territorial claims."

""the squid ink linguine is now paranza’s signature pasta. it perfectly combines coastal italian cuisine with the bounty of bahamian ingredients in this indulgent, spicy pasta dish finished with fresh seafood, calabrian chili paste, and bread crumbs,” said chef michael white. whiteleg prawn risotto & san diego uni whiteleg prawn risotto & san diego uni at aphotic in san francisco. in aphotic in san francisco, prawn risotto with uni and crab head foam. “the prawn risotto dish on our menu highlights our partnership with transparentsea farm out of downey, california. the risotto is actually much more complex, having many layers of shellfish incorporated in the flavor profile of this dish. we cook the rice in a shellfish stock that will contain a number of shellfish that we commonly use in-house - like spot prawn, dungeness crab, spiny lobster, etc. the rice is enriched with sea urchin butter, and dressed with a delicate foam made from aerated shellfish stock. we finish the dish with either fresh sea urchin roe, or brined spot prawn roe. this result is a decadent shellfish risotto of unparalleled luxury,” said peter hemsley, chef-owner of aphotic. agnolotti agnolotti at bestia mare in franklin, tennessee. at bestia mare in franklin, tennessee, potato leek, crab, local corn, tomato fonduta, fine herbs, pecorino. “agnolotti is one of my favorite filled/ravioli pastas to make that are small little pillows that are delicate and light if made properly. we serve ours at bestia mare with snow crab salty and savory flavor which pairs well with the sweetness of the butter sauce and corn. the reduced tomato sauce not only adds a pop of color to the dish but also adds a nice acidity along with the little lemon juice we add to help brighten up the dish. i like doing the potato-leek filling to help counterbalance all the flavors together but also to add a little rustic and simplicity twist to some slightly elevated ingredients,” said frank pullara, executive chef. cavatelli cavatelli at culaccino in franklin, tennessee. at culaccino in franklin, tennessee, slow braised oxtail ragu, sweet potato, rosemary, baby kale, and parmigiano. “this is a very rustic pasta dish made with a lot of love. we make the pasta dough with flour, house made ricotta, roasted sweet potato, egg and parmigiano and then roll it out, cut into two-inch strips and then one strip at a time, crank through a wooden dowel cavatelli pasta maker. the sauce is slowly braised for three hours with oxtail, aromatic vegetables, and herbs (onion, celery, carrot, rosemary, thyme), san marzano tomatoes, red wine, and stock. toss the cavatelli pasta with the ragu, roasted sweet potato to add a touch of sweetness and texture, baby kale to add a little touch of bitterness and then parmigiano to add a light creamy texture, as well as a little nutty note to the dish. this is a great fall and winter dish,” said frank pullara, executive chef. spaghetti chitarra alla vaniglia spaghetti chitarra alla vaniglia at sandro’s new york. at sandro’s new york, homemade egg pasta mixed with a madagascar vanilla butter sauce. topped with a slight dusting of vacche rosse parmigiano. “this dish came out of cravings and creativity. my father and i were hungry and brainstorming a sweet/savory dessert pasta and started snacking on ingredients in the kitchen. we came across vanilla and decided to create a cream sauce. we added vacche rosse cheese which offers a creamy, complex flavor to enhance the flavor and resulted in our new favorite pasta. we had two half portions, then sandro sized and it’s been a hit on the menu ever since,” said owner sandro fioriti jr. limonamba bucatini limonamba bucatini at branja  in miami. at branja  in miami, limonamba bucatini is branja’s version of a classic lemon pasta with an israeli twist. it incorporates preserved lemon, preserved peppers, and amba paste, while balancing the acidity and spiciness with the addition of honey, extra virgin olive oil, and crème fraiche. branja uses bucatini specifically because its hollow center absorbs the sauce much better than other pasta shapes. branja's chef tom aviv says: “the inspiration for this dish comes from our visits to local israeli markets, which have stalls and stands for pickled ingredients like pepper, cucumbers, and radishes, and also organic honey, preserved grape leaves, and more special ingredients to cook with and be inspired by. we pulled ingredients that we were excited to try and cook with and created this pasta dish with flavors that play on spicy, bitter, sour and sweet to stimulate the entire palate.” squid ink tonnarelli squid ink tonnarelli at north italia. at north italia, tiger shrimp, calamari, wild fennel pollen, mint, and spicy tomato broth. “i really love tonnarelli, which mimics the classic spaghetti alla chitarra that is well known in the abruzzo region of italy. tonnarelli differs from traditional spaghetti because of its squared cross-section, whereas spaghetti is round. this pairs perfectly with a tomato-based sauce because of its robust mouthfeel, plus it’s easy to eat. for our new fall menu, we’re elevating this pasta shape further by creating a squid ink version,” said north italia’s corporate chef, chris curtiss. saffron orzotto saffron orzotto at prohibition in charleston. at prohibition in charleston, executive chef and co-owner greg garrison traveled to greece with his wife to enjoy their babymoon and brought some inspiration home with him. garrison explains, ""of all of the dishes i enjoyed on the trip, i was particularly intrigued by the dishes that seemed to be influenced by italian cuisine, or possibly lent influence to italian cuisine. orzotto is an italian technique to replicate a risotto dish using orzo pasta instead of rice."" upon return, garrison immediately incorporated a southern-interpretation of this vegetarian dish. inspired by the heavy emphasis on vegetables in greek cuisine, as well as the origins of saffron, he serves it with a saffron and white wine cream sauce that is finished with parmesan cheese and complemented with seasonal vegetables and herbs. veal picatta & pasta veal picatta & pasta at dancing bear appalachian bistro in townsend, tennessee. at dancing bear appalachian bistro in townsend, tennessee, executive chef jeff carter serves crispy sweetbreads over italian apron pasta that is prepared with benton's bacon, preserved lemon, fried capers and mossy creek mushrooms. pumpkin ravioli pumpkin ravioli at nunzio. at nunzio by chef michael delone in collingswood, new jersey, this pumpkin ravioli is made with charcoal pasta, amaretto cream, toasted pepitas, and fried sage. “most pumpkin dishes lean into sweetness with expected cinnamon and nutmeg spices. our ravioli is surprising not only because the charcoal makes the pasta black but the dish is balanced with a savory base, a touch of sweetness is derived from the amaretto cream and crunch from the pepitas. plus, it is a fun nod to the spooky season while tasting delicious.” says chef michael delone of nunzio by chef michael delone. potato gnocchi potato gnocchi at the americano in atlanta. at the americano in atlanta, potato gnocchi with black truffle, chives, peas and parmigiano reggiano. “a well executed gnocchi is light, airy and has a perfectly smooth, palatable, almost purée-like texture. the sophistication is evident in the first bite — add truffles, butter and parmigiano and it becomes ethereal. it’s hands down one of my favorite dishes; don’t let the simplicity fool you…it’s far from simple,” said chef scott conant. truffle orecchiette & cheese truffle orecchiette & cheese at mayor’s table in newport beach, california. at mayor’s table in newport beach, california, the truffle orecchiette & cheese pasta at mayor’s table in newport beach marries hand-cut orecchiette pasta, cabot cheddar, and black truffle. “cabot cheddar and black truffle give this dish its elevated flavor profile, but the true craftsmanship comes from our handmade orecchiette pasta. this hand-cut pasta perfectly envelops the cheddar cream sauce, allowing each bite to tell a story of dedication to flavor, texture, and aroma. this dish is our ode to an american classic, elevated with bold yet simple ingredients,” said chef-partner riley huddleston. tagliatelle pomodoro tagliatelle pomodoro at miel restaurant in nashville. at miel restaurant in nashville, tagliatelle pasta with pomodoro (tomato-based sauce), burrata and pesto genovese. chef jason laiacona says, “at miel, we prioritize freshness in our seasonally inspired, ever-changing menu. with this summer’s abnormally hot weather, we still have tomatoes growing in heaps in our on-site garden which makes our tagliatelle pomodoro pasta dish the perfect transition into fall.” smoked spaghetti aglio e olio moked spaghetti aglio e olio via chef silvia barban of larina pastificio & vino in brooklyn. chef silvia barban of larina pastificio & vino in brooklyn has a dish with housemade smoked spaghetti using italian semolina flour, cooked in a sauce of garlic confit, corto olive oil, calabrian chilies. it is then finished with more pasta water and corto olive oil to emulsify or mantecare. topped with housemade focaccia breadcrumbs and crushed piedmontese hazelnuts. raviolo al uovo raviolo al uovo at bar56 in brooklyn, new york. at bar56 in brooklyn, new york, the raviolo al uovo is freshly made in house and includes bklyn ricotta, meadow creek egg, guanciale and black pepper. ""the raviolo al uovo is one of our most popular dishes at bar56 and was inspired by one of my favorite rustic italian dishes, pasta alla carbonara. the result is an elevated, elegant pasta but still with a hint of la cucina povera nostalgia,” said chef vincent cortese. squid ink trottole squid ink trottole at faccia a faccia in boston. at faccia a faccia in boston, trottole is a beautiful pasta that originates from the region of campania and directly translates to spinning head, due to the shape it forms in the pasta maker. often referred to as ""vesuvio"" in italy, as the trottole is said to resemble the volcano in naples. at faccia a faccia, they make their squid ink trottole within a sauce made by melting down butter, leeks, calabrian chilis, sun gold tomatoes and uni, locally sourced from maine and topped with pangrattato. ""i love our squid ink trottole. the brininess of the squid ink is delicious and pairs well with the sweet uni butter, melted leeks and parmesan reggiano. we add some toasted bread crumbs for crunch and a bit of calabrian chili to give it some punch. the twirling shape of the trottole, which means top, catches the sauce perfectly. makes for the perfect bite,” said brian rae, executive chef at faccia a faccia. cacio e pepe tteokbokki cacio e pepe tteokbokki at miss kim in ann arbor. at miss kim in ann arbor, this dish is made with sautéed rice cakes tossed in miso butter, freshly ground black pepper and really good parm, topped with just a bit of pickled red onions. “it’s an homage to ever evolving story of traditional korean rice cake dish tteokbokki, seen through korean american and roman lenses,” said ji hye kim. garganelli bolognese garganelli bolognese at porter house in new york city. at porter house in new york city, a beautiful take on garganelli bolognese. “this classic is one of our most popular dishes. our bolognese sauce is made according to a traditional family recipe of mine that i’ve been refining over the years. ground beef and veal and prosciutto are cooked with carrots, celery and onions, with chicken broth, white wine, tomato, and finished with milk. cooking slowly for hours to extract all the flavor of each ingredient, the bolognese sauce is finished with a bit of butter before tossing with pasta. we use an imported, artisanal pasta, made in small batches and extruded through bronze dies which leaves a fine, textured surface on the pasta, the better to hold the sauce. manufactured in abruzzo, italy by fourth generation pasta makers whose methods, ancient grains and flour and careful production makes their unique shapes unforgettable. most bolognese is served with fresh pasta but i prefer how this dry pasta garganelli holds up under the hearty bolognese sauce, holding the sauce in its fine grooves and creating a memorable meal,” said chef michael lomonaco.",Positive,"National Pasta Day celebrates the versatility of this beloved dish. Restaurants nationwide offer unique pasta creations, including agnolotti cacio e pepe, squid ink linguine, prawn risotto, potato leek agnolotti, slow braised oxtail ragu cavatelli, spaghetti chitarra alla vaniglia, limonamba bucatini, squid ink tonnarelli, saffron orzotto, veal picatta & pasta, pumpkin ravioli, potato gnocchi, truffle orecchiette & cheese, tagliatelle pomodoro, smoked spaghetti aglio e olio, raviolo al uovo, squid ink trottole, cacio e pepe tteokbokki, and garganelli bolognese."

(michael robinson chavez/the washington post via getty images) china produces nearly 80% of total world output according to usgs. north america—canada and mexico—produces only 1.2% of global graphite. that’s dwarfed by supplies coming out of the world’s top five producers—china, brazil, mozambique, russia, and madagascar. “every battery in every car in almost everything that’s practical that we’re talking about today, vehicles, energy storage, consumer electronics, almost all have graphite,” burns said. “if you look at either natural or synthetic graphite, there’s only a handful of companies talking about trying to build here in north america.” there will be more than 1 million tons/year of graphite demand by 2030 in north america alone, he said. meanwhile, “china controls the market,” burns said. “they can control or throttle the growth outside of the asian market if they control the upstream material,” he added. a man works in a workshop of a graphite company in jixi city, northeast china's heilongjiang ...

(photo by zhang tao/xinhua via getty images) on october 19, china’s ministry of commerce announced new export controls on battery grade graphite. beginning december 1, u.s. companies will be required to apply for permits to receive synthetic and natural graphite from china, which has two-thirds of the world’s natural graphite supply. u.s. companies already have the section 301 tariff, a 25% tariff on incoming graphite from china, which will review the waiver extension in december. novonix will produce synthetic graphite globally. for its tennessee plant, novonix will reconstruct petroleum coke from its largest shareholder, phillips 66, into battery ready powder for cell manufacturers including lg energy solution, panasonic, and samsung sdi. “when we buy petroleum-based coke products, we are almost upcycling those products into a cleaner ecosystem. if those were not distilled all the way down to the coking level, they would likely be sold off as fuel grade cokes or bunker oil for electricity,” burns said. novonix said it could eventually move to alternative feedstock, such as solid carbon from pyrolysis or biomass to lower cost or carbon intensity of graphite, as a feedstock. “the conversation is inherently complex. would it be cleaner to go through pyrolysis to get that solid carbon, i assume the net result of the answer would be yes,” he said. a slim but expanding market fewer than a dozen small companies around the world are testing methane pyrolysis to produce turquoise hydrogen, but they have attracted millions of dollars from dozens of energy companies, including some majors, over the past two years. the global hydrogen market is valued at about $170 billion this year, but it’s expected to expand to more than $300 billion by 2030 according to grandview research. the $15 million turquoise hydrogen market alone is expected to grow to $144 billion by 2030 when many energy companies and government have pledged to go net-zero or meet global climate goals. there’s only one commercial pyrolysis plant in the u.s., monolith nebraska llc’s olive creek facility in hallam, nebraska. doe guaranteed about $1 billion in loans for the facility which produces and sells hydrogen to make ammonia for agriculture. u.s. tire giants michelin and goodyear buy the carbon black byproduct. santa monica, california-based c-zero plans to be next and more efficient. “what’s unique with our approach is not using large quantities of electricity, and we produce a little bit of water,” said zach jones, c-zero’s chief executive and cofounder. blue and green hydrogen require water for production and green requires more energy to split the molecule. “thermodynamically it takes seven and a half times less energy to pull hydrogen off of carbon than it does to pull hydrogen off of oxygen,” jones said. “we consume some of the product hydrogen we produce to drive the reaction forward so the only energy source you need to deploy our technology is natural gas, either a pipeline or a tanker full of lng off the coast of korea or japan.” c-zero is focused on korea, japan, southeast asia, but also higher latitudes in north america and europe. “if it doesn’t work in asia, it isn’t going to work anywhere. they don’t have anywhere to sequester co2. the renewable capacity factor is not very good, and they have a strong societal will to pay a premium to decarbonize. that’s going to be the initial market for this,” jones said. since launching in 2018, c-zero has attracted investment from breakthrough energy ventures, eni next, mitsubishi heavy industries, ap ventures, sk gas, engie new ventures, and trafigura. doe’s office of energy efficiency and renewable energy’s hydrogen and fuel cell technologies office awarded c-zero $1 million in january 2020. while the company’s pilot will be fully commissioned by the first quarter of 2024 and run through the year, jones said he should also know where the company plans to put its first commercial pyrolysis facility by the second quarter of 2024. he said he’d like to sell the commercial operation to “any entity that is involved in the natural gas value chain, producer, distributor, consumer with a big balance sheet and a history of developing chemical processes, a company who can help with engineering and scaleup.” there are still hurdles to pyrolysis. “the challenge that any methane pyrolysis process has is you’re throwing away half the energy in the natural gas in the form of solid carbon,” jones said. translation: it takes twice as much natural gas to produce the same amount of energy. “if you have really dirty upstream methane emissions and you’re running those into a process where you need twice as much natural gas, those upstream methane emissions can bite you twice, whereas they only bite blue hydrogen once,” jones said. jones said his hope is that natural gas is going to be cleaned up from an upstream methane emission perspective. “it’s not a glamourous process. you’re still connected to fossil fuels. you’ve got giant piles of carbon you have to put back in the ground. you’re throwing away half the energy of natural gas, so it doesn’t really fit into anybody’s sweet spot. it doesn’t look great from a pr perspective,” jones said. it’s why start-up technology companies rather than oil and gas majors are driving pyrolysis, he said. “we feel like we’re in the right place at the right time with the right idea,” jones said. american petroleum institute’s vice president of natural gas markets, rob jennings, said “approximately 30 api member companies have invested in hydrogen technologies along the whole value chain.” those who are involved in pyrolysis are largely keeping a low profile. some oil and gas majors are testing the commercial viability of methane pyrolysis and plan to unveil results within a year, according to several sources familiar with those projects. beyond that, crickets. “monetizing carbon for u.s. majors, that’s never going to become part of their core business,” ashcroft said. “i don’t expect the exxonmobils of the world to go into the synthetic graphite refining industry, but they will make a handsome amount of money from selling this feedstock.” hydrogen + evs = biden’s energy policy while hydrogen production and electric vehicle expansion are central to president biden’s energy policy, the administration, which is infusing billions of dollars into both, is not linking the two. us president joe biden drives the new electric ford f-150 lightning at the ford dearborn development ... [+] center in dearborn, michigan on may 18, 2021. (photo by nicholas kamm / afp) (photo by nicholas kamm/afp via getty images) this month, the white house and the department of energy announced $7 billion to advance seven u.s. regional clean hydrogen hubs (h2hubs) to “accelerate the commercial-scale deployment of low-cost, clean hydrogen.” about two-thirds of the money will advance green hydrogen projects, those produced from renewable energy. the other third will be blue hydrogen projects using a process called steam methane reforming which splits the molecule into hydrogen and carbon dioxide gas and sequesters the co2 underground. no mention of methane pyrolysis in president biden’s announcement. the department of energy told forbes that it has not yet determined whether methane pyrolysis is “clean.” it must first examine the lifecycle emissions “well-to-gate” of methane pyrolysis, which is ongoing as the treasury department prepares to issue regulations about how it will dole out hydrogen production incentives outlined in the celebrated inflation reduction act. doe factors in upstream emissions from the feedstock, which in this case, is natural gas. it examines emissions at the production facility itself. “therefore, the question of whether h2 produced from methane pyrolysis is considered ‘clean’ will depend on the potential emissions from other parts of the lifecycle,” doe said.",Positive,"Turquoise hydrogen, produced via methane pyrolysis, offers a unique opportunity to align with the growing electric vehicle market by providing synthetic graphite, a critical mineral for EV batteries. This process is more efficient than traditional hydrogen production methods and generates solid carbon as a byproduct, which can be transformed into synthetic graphite. Despite its potential, methane pyrolysis faces challenges, including high natural gas consumption and the need to address upstream methane emissions. However, several companies are actively investing in this technology, recognizing its potential to contribute to the clean energy transition and the growing demand for graphite in the EV industry."

""we were able to raise about $78 million that we are going to use as cash transfers and government will provide 165,000 metrics tons to cover the deficit,"" he said. cyclone freddy, which also hit mozambique and madagascar, killed hundreds of people and displaced more than 650,000 people. the cyclone washed away 179,000 hectares of crop fields in southern malawi. maurine likoswe is a farmer whose maize field was washed away in chilobwe township in blantyre. likoswe said she is excited about the relief program but is hoping the assistance reaches all the beneficiaries. ""we are happy and eager to receive that donation, however we wish to call upon this government to do things differently from the way other governments have been doing. because, sometimes what happens is the real beneficiaries are sometimes left out and people who do not deserve to receive the items end up receiving,"" said likoswe. kalemba said everything is in place to curb any form of corruption. ""we will not tolerate corruption. we will not tolerate theft, and we will not tolerate fraud. just as we did last year, a number of councilors were arrested, a number of chiefs were arrested, and officers were arrested. we are going to arrest again anyone who tries to misdirect the aid that is going to the people who are vulnerable,"" he said. kalemba said people in southern malawi where cyclone freddy hit the hardest will receive the relief maize for six months. people in other districts will receive the maize for a period of between two and five months until the next harvesting season in march. ""because of the intensity of hunger that we are noting, in different places we may have to push some councils that we were supposed to start in december or january to push them to start in november and see how we move,"" he said. in the meantime, kalemba has advised people against selling the relief maize, saying those doing so will be arrested.

(“global li-ion” or, the “company”) (cse: lion, otcqb: gbbgf, f: 0td) is pleased to share the following. the president of madagascar has signed the new malagasy mining code into law. this new code is structured to better support sustainable development, good minerals and environmental governance, as well as benefiting the people of madagascar- all of which aligns with lion’s commitment to being a good corporate citizen. this is a very positive step in the realisation of the ambato-arana graphite mining project. moreover, madagascar’s ministry of mines and strategic resources has confirmed that the mine plan submitted by lion for the development of the project complies with existing regulatory requirements. the ministry may ask the company to provide specific additional data to its mining plan upon the implementation of the new mining code, which the government indicates is imminent. lion has prepared such data and information to meet any further request from the ministry. the company is taking all necessary steps to bring the project back into production. chairman jason walsh commented “we are very pleased that the signature of the new mining code accelerates the timeline for us to be able to restart graphite production at our ambato-arana project.” about ambato-arana graphite mine, madagascarthe 3 forty-year renewable mining exploitation licenses that comprise the project total 4,375 hectares (10,811 acres) are located in the vicinity of andasibe in toamasina province in madagascar, 20 km to the southwest of sheritt’s large-scale nickel/cobalt laterite open pit mine at ambatovy and 15 km northeast of the town of moramanga from which national highway rn2 connects with capital city antananarivo (114 km) and madagascar’s main port of toamisina (tamatave) (240 km). graphite was produced on the licenses, at a modest rate constrained by the technology employed on the licenses at that time, for roughly a century from 1910.  production was suspended by the previous owners due to a slump at the time in global graphite markets and with the deposits only partially mined. the deposits are now ready for larger scale exploitation with modern production techniques. they lie within the graphitic horizons of the highly prospective manampotsy formation and are associated with topographic highs that are exploited via free digging of lateritic ore and open pit mining, providing a lower cost exploitation without need for blasting. the graphite mineralization on the project appears within well-defined north-south belts with interbedded graphite-rich friable layers. the geological layers of interest have continuity of several kilometres and exhibit a shallow dip angle. sample data indicate good grade (up to 10% carbon content with some samples up to nearly 14%) and large flake (jumbo size) consistent with other nearby mines e.g. gallois (elate graphite), sahamamy & vatomina (tirupati graphite) and dni metals’ vohitsara (dni metals). further

""for the most part, protected area identification and conservation planning is geared towards the needs of mammals and birds. amphibians are falling through the cracks,"" said conservationist jennifer luedtke of the texas-based global nonprofit re:wild, co-coordinator of the iucn amphibian specialist group's red list authority and lead author of the study published in the journal nature. amphibians first appeared more than 300 million years ago. three orders of amphibians exist today: salamanders and newts (60 per cent threatened with extinction); frogs and toads (39 per cent); and the limbless and serpentine caecilians (16 per cent). since 2004, 306 species have crept closer to extinction, the study found. ""what is needed now is a global movement to catalyse the recovery of the world's amphibians,"" re:wild conservationist and study co-author kelsey neam said. the researchers identified four amphibian species - a frog from australia, a frog from guatemala, a salamander from guatemala and a toad from costa rica - that have disappeared since 2004. they also listed 185 species as ""possibly extinct,"" with no known surviving population. habitat destruction and degradation, caused mostly by animal agriculture and crops, remained the most common danger, affecting 93 per cent of the threatened amphibian species. but a growing proportion of species was being imperilled by disease and climate change, the researchers found. ""amphibians are particularly sensitive to changes in their environment, in part because they breathe through their skin,"" neam said. ""so the effects of climate change - increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, changes in moisture and temperature, sea-level rise and fires - can result in the loss of key breeding sites, increased mortality, habitat degradation, and habitat shifts that make it harder for amphibians to find suitable places to live,"" neam added. while an amphibian pandemic involving a fungal pathogen that causes the disease chytridiomycosis has waned, there is fresh concern that another fungal pathogen seen in asia and europe may enter the americas. the study also cited ongoing threats from the animal trade and human hunting for food. the heaviest concentrations of threatened amphibians were found to be in the caribbean islands, mexico and central america, the tropical andes region, india, sri lanka, cameroon, nigeria and madagascar. ""amphibians have evolved into an incredible diversity of sizes, colors and behaviors. they can be as tiny as a common housefly - macaya breast-spot frog - and as long as a cow - chinese giant salamander,"" neam said. ""amphibians are our allies in understanding the health of our planet,"" luedtke said. ""when we protect and recover amphibians, we protect and restore terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, we safeguard the genetic diversity of our planet, and we invest in a future in which all life - including human life - thrives.""",Negative,"Amphibians face a dire extinction crisis, with 41% of species threatened due to habitat loss, disease, and climate change. The situation has worsened since 2004, with 306 species now closer to extinction. Amphibians are particularly vulnerable to environmental changes due to their skin-breathing nature. The Caribbean, Central America, and Southeast Asia have the highest concentrations of threatened amphibians. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect these vital indicators of ecosystem health."

""it's good to be pain free after all this while,'' tafita told toi. he has to undergo rigourous physical rehabilitation for six to 12 months.after examining tafita for the first time in july, a tumor board headed by dr gundavda and having doctors from neurosurgery and surgery departments, decided to opt for three eight-hour surgeries spread over five days. ""in the first surgery, we focused on the anterior stage for separation of vital organs and vessels, and doctors from various oncosurgery specialties such as urology and vascular surgery were a part of it,"" said the doctor. the posterior side was handled during the second stage of surgery. here, the tumor was removed and reconstruction using metallic rods and screws were done in a third session. the patient needed 30 units of blood or blood products during the span of surgery over five days in july. he stayed thereafter for rehabilitation before leaving for home a few weeks back.kokilaben dhirubhai ambani hospital ceo dr santosh shetty, ""our hospital follows a full-timer system with our doctors present throughout the day for our patients. this made such a critical surgery possible for us,"" he said. dr gundavda added that the complex orthopedic oncology procedure would not have been possible without surgeons from other specialities.as for tafita, he is now back home and focused on rehabilitation. it was in 2017, just after he finished high school and was in the first year of university studying finance, that he felt the pain for the first time . he underwent a biopsy in 2017 itself, but didn’t follow up due to financial constraints. as he was soon unable to move, he completed his studies online and managed to get a remote job in a trading company. when his brother learnt about the government schemes to finance complicated surgery/treatment, he looked for options and reached out to doctors in the andheri hospital.

type (primary and secondary), by demand, by application (batteries and non-batteries), by region size and trends with impact of covid-19 and forecast up to 2028""report has been added toresearchandmarkets.com'soffering.the global cobalt market was valued at us$9.48 billion in 2022. the market value is expected to reach us$17.68 billion by 2028. the global cobalt market mined supply stood at 205.30 kilotonnes in 2022. whereas, the cobalt market demand is projected to rise to 267.33 kilotonnes by 2028. cobalt is a hard ferromagnetic, silver-white, hard, lustrous, brittle element. it is a member of group viii of the periodic table. cobalt is an important raw material for the production of battery materials, superalloys, high-temperature alloys, cutting tools, magnetic materials, petrochemical catalysts, pharmaceuticals, and glaze materials. owing to the benefits provided by the cobalt and the wide applications it serves, the cobalt market has been growing in the past few years. moreover, there are several new cobalt projects in development, which are expected to increase the supply of cobalt in the coming years. these projects are located in countries such as australia, the democratic republic of the congo (drc), and morocco. this would help to meet the growing demand for cobalt and stabilize the price of cobalt, resulting in market growth. the cobalt market is expected to grow at a cagr of approx. 11.0% over the projected period of 2023-2028. market segmentation analysis: the chemical segment takes the lead in market share and is projected to experience the most rapid growth in the forecasted period. this is attributed to the magnetic properties of metallic cobalt, which make it invaluable for crafting high-performance magnets used in electric motors, generators, and various other devices. the escalating use of electric motors and related devices has consequently driven up the demand for metallic cobalt, propelling market expansion. in 2022, the surge in cobalt production was driven by significant increases in the democratic republic of congo, which accounts for approximately 70% of global supply, as well as indonesia, an emerging player in this rapidly growing market. mine production is poised for continuous growth in the coming years, primarily due to further increases in production from congo and indonesia. as various industries, including electronics, renewable energy, and transportation, experience growth and demand for products containing cobalt, producers are intensifying their cobalt refining operations to meet this heightened demand. simultaneously, improved recycling technologies and growing awareness of resource sustainability are anticipated to boost the recycling of cobalt-containing materials, contributing to an increased refined supply in the years ahead. while cobalt is present in most portable devices used in daily life, electric vehicles (evs) surpassed electronics as the major source of demand in 2022. the combination of ev purchase subsidies, part of post-covid economic stimulus packages in the eu and china, and the pandemic-induced shift in consumer spending patterns significantly accelerated demand for cobalt in evs in 2020 and 2021. geographically, asia, particularly china, japan, and south korea, dominates as the largest cobalt-consuming region, reflecting the concentration of battery materials production in asia. the battery segment claims the largest share of the market and is forecasted to be the fastest-growing segment in the foreseeable future. this segment is further categorized into electric vehicles, electronics, energy storage systems (ess), and power devices & motive products. countries such as the eu, the us, japan, and china have consistently raised standards for vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions over the past 15 years, incentivizing automotive manufacturers to develop electric alternatives to traditional internal combustion engine designs. consumer preferences are increasingly shifting toward more environmentally friendly vehicles, leading to a rise in ev sales, thereby supporting cobalt market growth. the report offers insights into the cobalt market's mined supply based on regions, including congo (drc), indonesia, russia, australia, canada, cuba, madagascar, and the rest of the world. drc currently holds the largest market share, while indonesia is poised to be the fastest-growing region in the coming years. efforts to regulate and legitimize the artisanal and small-scale mining (asm) sector in the drc, including the establishment of a state-owned company to purchase and market all asm cobalt, as well as industry-driven responsible sourcing initiatives, are expected to enhance transparency and ethical sourcing practices in the cobalt supply chain. this will further bolster the cobalt market's growth in the drc in the coming years. indonesia's increased cobalt production is primarily attributed to four new high-pressure acid leaching (hpal) facilities that process ore to produce both nickel and cobalt in mixed hydroxide precipitate, which can then be exported. more such facilities are in development, including the us$2.6 billion sonic bay nickel-cobalt hydrometallurgical complex, a joint venture between eramet and basf. consequently, the indonesian region presents lucrative growth opportunities for the cobalt market in the foreseeable future. competitive landscape: in 2022, glencore produced 43.80 kilotonnes of cobalt. also, in 2022, glencore and general motors co. announced a multi-year sourcing agreement in which glencore would supply gm with cobalt from the company's murrin murrin operation in australia. global market analysis competitive analysis global

exports of key battery mineral graphite on friday, miners
elsewhere face a race against time to bring new projects to
fruition to secure supplies for the next generation of electric
vehicles. china will require export permits for some graphite products
to protect national security, its commerce ministry said, in its
latest move to safeguard supplies of critical minerals and
protect its manufacturing dominance. the world's top graphite producer and exporter also refines
more than 90% of the material used in virtually all electric
vehicles' (evs) battery anodes, which is the negatively charged
portion of a battery. the next generation of evs is due to hit around 2025 and
several carmakers have sought help plugging gaps in supply after
years of pandemic-related parts shortages highlighted the risks
of over-reliance on one country. to stay ahead in a fast-changing industry, carmakers have
been investing directly in mining projects to ensure future
supplies of the battery inputs. but building mines takes between five and 10 years, meaning
china will keep its lead in supplying graphite for at least half
a decade, miners in other countries say, as those projects are
mostly still in pre-production. ""what china is saying to the west with this decision is that
we are not going to help you make electric cars, you have to
find your own way to do that,"" northern graphite ceo
hugues jacquemin said. china's move took multiple sectors by surprise, with some
end-users fearing more curbs could follow. ""we see china's move as a potential catalyst to highlight
the urgency of improving domestic graphite supply,"" said john
demaio, president of graphex's graphene division. ""we've aligned ourselves with several graphite miners
outside of china. i would imagine this news will accelerate
their plans to bring capacity online in the near term,"" demaio

magnets found in electric vehicles, wind turbines, and consumer
electronics such as iphones. ""the battery controls a lot of the cost of a vehicle, so if
carmakers outside of china are forced to use very expensive
materials or can't access them,...that is going to ramp up their
prices or force them to purchase the batteries from chinese
battery manufacturers,"" said stefan bernstein, ceo of greenroc
mining, owner of a graphite project in greenland that
is due to reach production in 2027. northern graphite's jacquemin said the company had been
getting calls from oems (original equipment manufacturers) on
what impact china's latest move would have, concerned about
supply security for batteries and other electronics equipment. he said china's move meant northern graphite could
encourage investors to raise money to hit production by 2027. shishir poddar, executive chairman of tirupati graphite
, which has mining and processing operations in
madagascar and recently acquired two projects in mozambique,
said the import curbs will ""further boost the development of
ex-china graphite activities"".   (reporting by nelson banya, clara denina, divya rajagopal,
ernest scheyder; editing by veronica brown and elaine
hardcastle)",Neutral,"China's export restrictions on graphite, a key battery mineral, have prompted miners worldwide to accelerate new projects to secure supplies for electric vehicles. China's dominance in graphite production and refining poses challenges for carmakers seeking to reduce reliance on a single source. Miners outside China are facing a race against time to bring projects online, as building mines can take years. China's move highlights the urgency of developing domestic graphite supply chains and could accelerate investment in non-Chinese mining projects."

activities report –september 2023  african mineral sands producer,base resources limited(asx & aim: bse) (base resourcesor thecompany) is pleased to provide an operational, development and corporate update for the quarter ended30 september 2023. key points   the kwale south and north dunes continued to be mined concurrently during the quarter, with two hydraulic mining units operating in each area.mined tonnage was steady at 4.1 million tonnes (mt) (last quarter: 4.1mt).mining rates in the north dune improved during the quarter after the water pressure for one of the hydraulic mining units was boosted from the standard 25 bar to 32 bar.a second higher pressure hydraulic mining unit will be commissioned when mining commences on the bumamani deposit in the march quarter of 2024.consistent with mine plan, the heavy mineral (hm) grade of ore mined in the quarter was lower than last quarter at 2.5% (last quarter: 3.0%), and consequently, heavy mineral concentrate (hmc) production was lower at 84.8kt (last quarter: 103.2kt).  as ore grades and hmc production will be lower for the remainder of kwale operations’ mine life, the mineral separation plant (msp) was transitioned, as planned, from continuous operations to campaign processing to ensure optimum product recoveries are maintained, with extended shuts between campaigns to allow hmc stocks to rebuild.the combination of lower hmc production and msp shuts reduced the hmc fed to the msp in the quarter to 71.6kt (last quarter: 106.1kt), resulting in a corresponding fall in production for all products.  deposition of sand tails into the mined out north dune pit p199 commenced in the quarter, with sand tails also continuing to be deposited on the mined-out central dune area.to aid water retention and subsequent rehabilitation, the sand tails are capped with a co-disposed slimes/sand layer.rehabilitation activities on the central dune, south dune and north dune proceeded to plan.  summary by quarter fy23 fy24

dispatched (last quarter: 89.5kt).containerised shipments of rutile and zircon through the mombasa port also proceeded to plan.despite lower production levels for the remainder of kwale operations’ mine life, the company plans to continue bulk shipments of ilmenite (up to 54kt lots) and rutile (between 5-10kt lots), which will result in greater volatility in quarterly sales volumes, as illustrated by the sales volumes for this quarter.  unit operating costs have increased tous$343per tonne produced (rutile, ilmenite, zircon and low-grade products) (last quarter:us$240per tonne) due to the lower production.despite this, total cash operating costs ofus$18.6 millionwere marginally lower than the prior quarter (last quarter:us$18.8 million).  cost of goods sold increased tous$442per

production guidance – kwale operations”, for the assumptions upon which the guidance is based.] market conditions became increasingly challenging through the september quarter due to growing economic uncertainty and softening property sectors across all key markets.however, firm demand continued for base resources’ products through the quarter and sales were in line with expectations.prices held up well for ilmenite and rutile, but zircon prices moderated due to the sluggish conditions that emerged during the latter part of the june quarter.  ilmenite demand and prices inchinaremained relatively stable through the quarter as major chinese pigment plants maintained high levels of production.the domestic pigment market inchinawas subdued through most of the quarter but saw a seasonal improvement towards the end of the quarter.export opportunities for chinese pigment producers increased through the quarter as significant pigment production capacity intaiwanandeuropewas closed.chloride pigment producers inchina, which are reliant on imported ilmenite, continued to build and ramp up new production capacity which supported demand for base resources’ ilmenite.  major western pigment producers have continued to sacrifice sales volumes to support stable prices and, as a result, production rates were well below capacity levels to avoid a build-up of inventory and demand for high-grade titanium dioxide feedstocks was consequently reduced.while one major high-grade feedstock producer has suspended production of synthetic rutile for at least four months, which will assist in offsetting the drop in demand, downward pressure on rutile prices is expected to continue building.  rutile demand from the smaller welding and titanium metal sectors remained firm in the quarter.sales into these sectors command a significant price premium over bulk rutile for the tio2 pigment market, but this premium is expected to reduce as some high-grade feedstock supply to the pigment sector is re-directed to these sectors.base resources is maintaining its approach of increasing the proportion of its rutile sales to the welding sector.  the weakening conditions in the chinese and european zircon markets towards the end of the june quarter led to a reduction in contracted zircon prices for september quarter.global demand for zircon has continued to soften through the quarter and prices will moderate further for december quarter contracts. health and safety  there were no lost time injuries during the quarter and, with no lost time injuries in the past 12 months, base resources has a lost time injury frequency rate (ltifr) of 0.0 per million hours worked.compared to the western australian all mines 2020/2021 ltifr of 2.0, this is an exceptional performance and reflects the ongoing focus and importance placed on safety.with no medical treatment injuries recorded in the last 12 months, base resources’ total recordable injury frequency rate is 0.0per million hours worked.  community and environment – kwale operations  farmers participating in the company’s agricultural livelihood programs in kwale county, implemented through the pavi farmers’ cooperative, commenced harvesting of cotton and maize crops towards the end of the quarter and are also commencing preparations for what is expected to be a successful growing season, with above average rainfall forecast for the december quarter’s ‘small rains’ as an el nino weather pattern develops.  training on business, entrepreneurship and leadership was delivered to 21 women’s groups during the quarter, with the approximately 350 participants also receiving support from the company for various income generating initiatives.  the ‘long rains’, which normally run april to june, extended well into the september quarter allowing a further 30,000 trees to be planted as part of the company’s rehabilitation efforts, bringing the total planted for the rainy season to 80,000trees.no instances of environmental non-compliance, major environmental incidents or environment-related community complaints were identified or recorded during the quarter.  community and environment – toliara project  all community training programs and social infrastructure projects remain on hold while the toliara project’s on-ground activities are suspended. toliara project development –madagascar engagement with the government ofmadagascaron toliara project fiscal terms and lifting of the project’s on-ground suspension has been limited during the quarter, principally due to the government focus on preparations for the upcoming presidential elections. the new mining code was recently passed into law and now applies to the company’s toliara project.  key financial elements of the new mining code relevant to the toliara project are:  the application of the above elements, and several other key provisions of the new mining code, lack sufficient detail to fully assess their potential impact on the toliara project.other provisions that may impact the project include any prescribed specifications (conditions) attaching to the project’s exploitation permit 37242, minimum requirements for the project’s corporate social responsibility plan (which will include social investment, infrastructure spending and local content requirements), prescribed annual mining fees and requirements for an environmental and rehabilitation provision.  the government is preparing the implementing decree for the new mining code, a draft of which should shortly be available for industry consultation.greater clarity on the new mining code and its application to the toliara project is expected once the implementing decree is finalised together with any further supporting regulations, orders and decrees.  separately, the first round of the presidential elections have been deferred by a week to16 november 2023, with the second round (if needed) scheduled for 20december 2023.the incumbent president has declared his candidacy and officially resigned on9 september 2023to commence campaigning.  until the full suite of mining code reform is completed and elections finalised, the company does not expect to achieve material progress in securing fiscal terms or lifting of the project’s on-ground suspension.the company remains ready and committed to progressing the world class toliara project to a final investment decision once fiscal terms are secured and the on-ground suspension is lifted.  the toliara rare earths pre-feasibility study of the economic potential of the monazite contained in the toliara project’s ranobe mineral resources estimate continued in the quarter and remains on track for completion in the march quarter of 2024.

future of kenya's garment trade, which has employed her for 13
years and helped her put six children through school and
university, lies in the hands of the u.s. congress. and like others, she is worried. u.s. officials visiting south africa this week to meet
african trade ministers will face calls to reauthorise the
african growth and opportunity act (agoa) which expires in 2025. despite longstanding bipartisan support from lawmakers, who
view washington's flagship african trade initiative as critical
to taking on china, deep dysfunction on capitol hill and
divisions over the need for updates have raised doubts. apparel companies and industry insiders warn that africa
risks a once-in-a-generation shift away from chinese
manufacturing passing it by, with an estimated 240,000 to
290,000 jobs such as nasimiyu's under threat. ""we are praying that they extend,"" the single mother said
during a break from stitching levi's jeans at a nairobi factory.
""it is very hard to get a job here in kenya."" apparel has been the standout success story of agoa, which
launched in 2000 to help develop african economies and foster
democracy. african apparel exports under the programme reached nearly
$1.4 billion last year, double the amount pre-agoa. pankaj bedi, chairman of ual and norah nasimiyu's employer,
said agoa's duty free access to the world's biggest consumer
market is the reason his company - kenya's largest garment
producer - exists. ""almost 100% of what we are exporting goes to the u.s.""  bypassing africa industry insiders and policymakers see a chance to build on
that success as companies reduce their dependence on china in
the wake of the pandemic and subsequent supply chain headaches. ""we've been struck by how open the opportunity is now for
us,"" south african trade minister ebrahim patel said last week. nearly 80% of companies polled in a july survey by the
united states fashion industry association (usfia) planned to
reduce chinese sourcing over the next two years. ""many of them talk about africa,"" said stephen lamar, ceo of
the american apparel and footwear association. capturing even a fraction of that business could prove
transformative for africa. but companies need clarity, he said,
adding: ""if it is not renewed until two years from now, these
current investment decisions are going to bypass africa"". that lack of clarity is not only hitting new investments. the usfia survey found that 45% of respondents had already
reduced sourcing from agoa countries over renewal uncertainty,
while another 45% plan to cut sourcing from the continent if
there is no reauthorisation by june 2024.  'collapse' african governments are pushing for a similar
reauthorisation to the 10-year agoa extension approved by
congress in 2015 with bipartisan support, ideally before an
expected u.s. election year pause on new trade legislation. but that is looking increasingly unlikely. ""there's a high level of uncertainty about what happens and
the context keeps shifting,"" said michael walsh, a senior fellow
at the philadelphia-based foreign policy research institute. amid deepening global polarisation, moscow, beijing and the
west are all leveraging trade and economic ties as they step up
efforts to court african governments. more than a dozen u.s. senators are pushing for a quick agoa
renewal arguing the need to ""counter the malign influence of
china, russia, and other foreign actors"". but the house of representatives, paralysed for weeks by
factional fighting over its speakership, faces a daunting list
of must-pass legislation. and there is another obstacle to a quick reauthorisation,
namely a well-intentioned desire to improve agoa. the u.s. international trade commission (usitc) in a report
earlier this year highlighted major shortcomings. more than 80% of duty-free non-petroleum agoa exports, for
example, came from south africa, kenya, lesotho, madagascar and
ethiopia. ""some countries have benefited greatly from agoa, but the
majority have not,"" constance hamilton, the biden
administration's top trade official for africa, said last week,
calling for congress to consider changes that would ""make the
programme more impactful"". such talk worries apparel company executives, who point to
the troubled fate of the generalized system of preferences (gsp)
- the largest and oldest u.s. trade preference programme. congress failed to renew gsp before it expired at the end of
2020 and its reauthorisation remains bogged down in gridlock
between the house and senate over eligibility requirement
changes. attempts to change agoa risk creating a similar impasse,
said greg poole, senior advisor for global sourcing at clothing
company the children's place. ""if we try to radically change agoa, it's going to get
stalled out. and if it gets stalled out, it's going to follow
the path of gsp,"" he said. there is little doubt what would happen in agoa's absence. the usitc report said agoa benefits ""appear to be essential
for ... countries to maintain their apparel exports to the
united states"". it pointed to a temporary suspension of madagascar's agoa
benefits in 2009, which cost it 50,000 to 100,000 jobs, while
ethiopia lost 100,000 jobs when it was suspended last year. in kenya, ual chairman bedi remains hopeful, but knows how
things will play out if agoa evaporates. ""all the companies which are here will be gone for sure,
including mine ... the industry will collapse."" (reporting by joe bavier in johannesburg and duncan miriri in
nairobi; editing by alexander smith)",Neutral,"The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which provides duty-free access to the US market for African exports, expires in 2025. African governments are urging its early renewal, as companies are shifting production away from China due to pandemic-related supply chain disruptions. However, uncertainty over AGOA's future is hindering investment and threatening the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of workers in the African garment industry."

""how do we build trust? we build trust through dialogues such as the gmc, joint exercises, industrial collaboration, sharing of resources, respecting international law etc,"" singh said, adding that the trust amongst cooperating countries will lead to optimal outcomes in common maritime priorities.  ""since our countries interact with each other on a multitude of issues. it is possible to build trust by discussion and consultation with each other,"" the defence minister said.  quoting the sanskrit adage 'sanghe shakti kaliyuge', singh said in the present era, strength lies in collaboration and cooperation, and cooperative equilibrium can also be achieved in international relations.  ""in our context, common maritime priorities such as tackling climate change, controlling piracy, terrorism, drug trafficking and overfishing at the high seas need to be addressed by all of us cooperatively.  ""if the threats that we face are supranational in scope and impact, international efforts to address them will indeed have limited effects,"" the defence minister said, adding that regional challenges can be managed through multinational collaborative mitigation frameworks.  illegal, unreported and unregulated (iuu) fishing is a challenge related to over-exploitation of resources in the region, singh said.  iuu fishing  threatens the ecosystem, economic security and regional and global food security, he said, adding that it is a common maritime priority to control iuu fishing.  multinational collaboration efforts for the compilation, coalition and sharing of surveillance data was the need of the hour, he said.  ""it will help in identifying actors with irregular or threatening behaviour, which needs to be countered resolutely,"" singh added.  he further said that the ""pandemic of climate irresponsibility"" will threaten societies, and just like the recent pandemic ( covid-19 ), there is a vaccine available (for the climate pandemic).  ""it is a vaccine of collaboration, climate responsibility and climate justice. if all countries accept the responsibility to cut the emission by investing in green economy and shared technology, there is no reason why humanity cannot overcome this problem as well,"" singh said.  our narrow immediate interests tempt us to flout or disrespect the international laws, but doing so will lead to the breakdown of civilised maritime intercourse, he said.

from the maldives. “seen from the zero-sum lens that often drives great power competition, beijing is a big winner from this election,” michael kugelman, south asia director at the wilson center, a washington-based think-tank, told al jazeera. “muizzu’s campaign plank was not only about strengthening ties with beijing, it was also about aiming to undermine india by calling for an end to any indian military presence in maldives. this is music to the ears of beijing,” he added. to be sure, india will look to retain as much of its influence in the maldives as it can, say analysts. following the announcement of muizzu’s victory, indian prime minister narendra modi sent his congratulations to the president-elect. “india remains committed to strengthening the time-tested india-maldives bilateral relationship and enhancing our overall cooperation in the indian ocean region,” modi said on x, formerly known as twitter.      new delhi has enjoyed cosy ties with male under president solih, who took office following a landslide victory in 2018 against muizzu’s mentor, former president abdulla yameen. india poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the tourist hot spot. new delhi also financed infrastructure projects, both big and small, in the country. “india will support the new democratically elected government and will seek to work closely with it,” shantanu roy-chaudhury, author of the china factor: beijing’s expanding engagement in sri lanka, maldives, bangladesh, and myanmar, told al jazeera. the modi government, he said, is “likely to continue its pursuit of the greater male connectivity projects” — a 6.7km (4-mile) road project currently under construction that aims to link the capital, male, with the island of villingili. india has given the maldives a $100m grant and a $400m line of credit for the infrastructure initiative. but the road ahead won’t be easy for new delhi, said roy-chaudhury. “given the new government’s pro-china outlook, the future of indian influence and development projects hangs in the balance,” he said. muizzu, a 45-year-old civil engineer by training, has taken aim at the imbalanced trade relationship between the maldives and india, promising to fix it. but while trade between the south asian neighbours is heavily skewed towards india — as is often the case between a giant economy and a smaller one — the maldives fares little better when it comes to china. india’s exports to the maldives amounted to$416m in 2021, while it imported $49m from the smaller nation. china, meanwhile, exported goods worth$395mto the maldives, and its imports were valued at $3.9m. muizzu emerged as an unexpected candidate to lead the progressive party of maldives (ppm), after serving as the construction minister in the administration of yameen. a path to the country’s top seat opened up for him after yameen, also a pro-china leader, was put behind bars on corruption charges. under yameen, the maldives obtained more than $1bn in loans from china to finance huge infrastructure projects, including housing for residents of land-scarce male and a first-of-its-kind bridge connecting the congested capital to nearby suburb and airport islands.      analysts say the change of guard in male could present an opportunity for not just beijing but also chinese investors. “beijing will certainly try to move in, though i wouldn’t overstate the impact of the election on its investment patterns,” kugelman said. “even in the era of solih, who was pro-india but not hostile to china, we saw some continued chinese commercial collaborations with the maldives – not on the level we saw during the yameen era, but still substantive activity. certainly, though, muizzi’s victory will be empowering, for chinese investors as well as chinese grand strategists and diplomats.” kugelman said the election results might be a “body blow” to india, both diplomatically and geopolitically, but new delhi will not throw in the towel. “by no means is new delhi planning to raise the red flag and effectively cede the maldives to china. that would fly in the face of its intense competition with beijing,” he said. “new delhi will remain confident it can continue to have some degree of partnership with male.” as muizzu prepares to take office on november 17, roy-chaudhury said the new leader of the maldives might not be able to abandon new delhi completely and pivot towards beijing even if he wanted to. india, he said, would continue to emphasise its developmental aid and seek to build on it. “india and the maldives both need each other.”          follow al jazeera english:",Neutral,"Mohamed Muizzu's election victory in the Maldives has shifted the balance of power in the Indian Ocean region, with

search data for 119 bucket list places to visit in 219 countries. the results paint a vivid picture of travel aspirations, spanning from the breathtaking shores of the maldives to the thundering majesty of niagara falls, encompassing iconic landmarks and awe-inspiring natural wonders along the way. according to sheena paton, senior program manager, this is the first time kuoni has assembled this travel bucket list . “we’ve previously created travel stories that have analyzed the demand for different locations or the best landmarks to visit, but this unique study looks at every country's most popular bucket list item,” paton told me in an interview. “we were intrigued to see how this might vary from country to country and which experiences would come out on top, so we decided to do

travel bucket list for 121 countries. “it’s great to see that a trip to the maldives is considered a bucket list item for so many people,” says paton. “it’s a tropical paradise popular amongst honeymooners, families and retirees alike.” coincidentally, in 2021 kuoni looked at where the world wants to travel most. “the top destinations to travel to that year were the maldives, mexico and

""bio-erosion and the coral microbiome—the bacteria that lives in its tissues—are not fully understood yet. these two facets, particularly the coral microbiome, could drastically change our understanding of how coral health is affected by climate change and human activities.""while their analysis found that the authors of these papers are highly interconnected, they discovered that authors from countries such as maldives and papua new guinea, are not as represented within the literature as they should be for the amount of coral reefs within those ocean territories.this bias, referred to as academic colonialism, omits the knowledge base of the researchers who live and breathe the threats to and benefits of these major coral reef systems. the team warn that this could leave certain threats unaddressed and certain reefs unprotected from the stressors that lead to reef decline.""so, for example, as we had seen that most of the researchers are coming from america, it might explain why we have so much research on coral bleaching, because there have been lots of coral bleaching events that have been well documented in the caribbean and hawaii, compared to events that are happening in other coral reefs, for example, disease outbreaks in the coral sea, right off the coast of indonesia.""additionally, using citation information and alternative metrics of impact, the data also provide a sense of the reach of the research within and outside of academia, for example, whether work has been used in policymaking or conservation practices.the team found that more than 80% of papers stated that the review's primary purpose was to inform coral conservation. however, data the team collected from a citation repository also revealed that the reviews were only cited in policy 0.565 times, on average.""we were surprised to find that very little of the research was actually reaching outside of academia. incorporating research in policy could be improved through greater research accessibility and continuing to gather public interest in coral reefs.""increasing public trust in sciencethe researchers hope that in being transparent about the current research landscape, they can encourage higher standards of research integrity. ""identifying areas where we can make science more accessible to the public is definitely going to improve how we can engage with our intended audiences as researchers.""by highlighting countries with large coral reef ecosystems, such as the maldives and indonesia, which are underrepresented in the literature, burke hopes that these biases can be addressed with changes in funding.""these local researchers provide a wealth of knowledge and are intimately familiar with the community's relationship with coral reefs. when we include these researchers in studies of coral health, we tap into a great source of information and encourage a passion for coral reef conservation in the public.""importantly, the methods used in the study are very reproducible, systematic processes that scientists in other areas of research can use to conduct similar assessments in their field of interest.""these methods are relatively new to ecology, and especially new in terms of marine ecology,"" says burke. ""so, seeing these techniques get picked up in other topics could provide a better picture of what's going on in our reefs and what's going on in our oceans.""ultimately, the team hope that this research will push coral health research in a new direction—one that produces research of higher quality, collaboration, and efficiency.""as coral reefs decline, we should also aim to rebuildpublic trustin research and strengthen the evidence base for the imperative conservation of our reefs.""",Neutral,"Coral reefs face collapse due to climate change, prompting research biases.

shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: foreign minister of canada's comments? vineeta pandey: yes. shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: update on? vineeta pandey: she said that, you know, she is talking to india, you know, that she is engaging india in private conversation with regard to repatriation of the diplomats. so any development on that? shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: what's your query? vineeta pandey: the question is that, has the talk begun? has she met, her team met the indian side on, you know, removing the 41 diplomats that are extra here? ayushi agarwal: sir, ayushi agarwal from ani. sir, my question is regarding the closure of the afghan embassy in new delhi. they recently put out a statement where they said there was a lack of support from the host government of india. so your comment on that, also, what would be the fallout of this on the afghans living in india, especially the students? john reed: john reed from the ft. is it true, as we've been told, that india has given canada a deadline of october 10th to repatriate about 41 of its diplomats? and if they were to stay beyond that date, what would india do? would they become persona non grata? and have you also identified who these people should be and told canada who they should send back? thank you. sidhant: sir, sidhant from wion. sir, what's india's view or reaction when it comes to the change of guard in maldives? we know that the elections happened and someone who's, of course, an opposition candidate won the elections. yeshi seli: so this is yeshi seli from the new indian express. a week...10 days back, the u.s. ambassador to pakistan had gone to balochistan. and eric garcetti, when we questioned him, said that if we can go to kashmir for g20, i see no harm in his going to balochistan. any comments on that? shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: which part? the comment or the actual visit? both? yeshi seli: gilgit-baltistan. i'm sorry. i stand corrected. so any comments? shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: comment on what? comment on visit or comment on the comment? yeshi seli: no. comment on what ambassador garcetti said that, it doesn't matter and if they can go there, they can come here. india generally does oppose, you know, dignitaries and diplomats..... shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: it's okay. i'll try to answer your question. okay. let me start. maybe actually, why don't i start yeshi with your query on the comment or the visit. let me answer both. look, i think our position on the status of the entire union territory of jammu and kashmir, that being an integral part of india, is well known. we would urge the international community to respect our sovereignty and territorial integrity. we have raised our concerns about that visit; a visit by the pakistani ambassador, i mean the u.s. ambassador to pakistan; with the u.s. side. and as regards your comment also, i think ambassador garcetti's comment, we don't think the two situations are equivalent. as regards the issue of afghan embassy, ayushi...look, on that one, our understanding is that the embassy in new delhi is functioning or continuing to function. we are in touch with the afghan diplomats who are there in that embassy, as well as with the afghan diplomats who are at the consulates in mumbai and hyderabad. however, we received a communication last week purportedly from the embassy, indicating that it intends to suspend operations at the end of september, i think it was. of course, such a decision is an internal matter of a foreign mission. however, we have noted that the afghan consulates general in mumbai and in hyderabad voiced their objection to that decision or to such a decision. we are also aware that there has been a prolonged absence of the ambassador and that a large number of afghan diplomats have left india in recent past. you asked about what would be the difficulties with the students. we would hope that a substantial or the substantial number of afghan nationals in india, including students, are able to continue to receive necessary consular support. on our part, we will continue with our efforts to assist the people of afghanistan, and i think that takes care of both your concerns that you mentioned. before i come to canada, sidhant, on the issue of maldives...look, you would have seen the developments there. prime minister was the first leader to convey greetings and felicitations to the president-elect. prime minister conveyed and reaffirmed india's commitment to strengthen the time-tested india-maldives bilateral relationship and enhancing overall cooperation in the indian ocean region. subsequently yesterday, i think, our high commissioner in male also called on the president-elect. he had a good discussion on various aspects of our bilateral partnership, including development cooperation. let me take the opportunity to congratulate the maldivian people for once again demonstrating their faith in democratic governance and constitutional processes that reflect their firm commitment to the values of democracy and the rule of law. john, your question as well as i think vineeta's question on talks, basically on canada. look, you would recall last week we had a substantial, quite lengthy conversation on canada. insofar as discussions on parity, as we have mentioned earlier, given the much higher diplomatic presence of canadian diplomats or diplomatic presence here of canada and their continuing interference in our internal affairs, we had and we have sought parity in our respective diplomatic presence. discussions are ongoing on the modalities of achieving this. specific question by you, john, regarding dates, et cetera. look, i would not like to get into the details of diplomatic conversations. as we mentioned, i think last week, given that canadian diplomatic presence is very much higher, we would assume that there would be a reduction. i think that broadly covers those issues. shashank mattoo: shashank mattoo with the mint, just to follow up on sidhant's question, the newly elected maldivian... the maldivian president-elect, mentioned his intention to ask indian troops to leave the maldives. did our high commissioner raise that concern with the newly elected president? pia: hi, pia with the print. it has been made aware that the consul generals from the afghan consulates were in delhi to meet the mea earlier this week. is there any plan to shift diplomats from afghan consulates to the mission in delhi, and will there be any replacement of the former ambassador farid mamundzay? thank you. madhurendra: sir, madhurendra hoon news nation se. american report ke mutabik china jo hai wo deceptive methods ko use kar raha hai disinformation ke liye, bharat mein bhi jis tarah ka nivesh samne aaya hai aur uske baad ed ke actions bhi dikhai de rahe hain. kya aapka reaction hai? china ka antarashtiya media mai interference aur bharat ke media mai bhi interference ko lekar? [question in hindi: approximate translation] sir, i am madhurendra from news nation. according to the american report, china is using deceptive methods for disinformation. also the type of investments in india, that have come to light followed by actions by the ed. what is your reaction to china's interference in international media and also in indian media? shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: okay. any specific aap kuch kehna chahte hain ya generally? [question in hindi: approximate translation] anything specific you want to ask or is it generally? madhurendra: sawal american reports par hain jo kehta hain ki deceptive methods ka istemal china kar raha hai, manipulate karne ke liye antarashtiya media ko. [question in hindi: approximate translation] the question is about american reports that suggest china is using deceptive methods to manipulate international media. kallol: kallol from the hindu. taking that question forward, there is this american entrepreneur neville singham who has hit the headlines for his support to various media initiatives. do you think the indian government would take it up with the u.s. counterpart on the issue of neville singam's media initiatives that are related to india, including the latest newsclick issue? geeta mohan: geeta mohan with india today. this is regarding khalistanis not in canada but in the united states of america and london. you have paramjeet singh pamma who took part in the protests outside the indian high commission. he is a wanted criminal in the nia list... a wanted terrorist, not a criminal. and on the other hand, u.s. state department, when asked about seeks for justice, said that they have a right to protest. it is enshrined in the constitution of america. your comments on khalistanis being given space in u.s. and in the u.k.? shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: okay, let me take this round and i'll come back to another one. okay, shashank, your query on maldives, i mean, you specifically talk about cooperation, security sector. look, all i would say is, i don't want to comment on... i think you talked about media reports, to be honest. the focus of our partnership with maldives has always been on capacity building and working together to address our shared challenges and priorities, you know, including security challenges and priorities. as neighbours, we need to collaborate closely to address these challenges confronting our region, such as transnational crimes as well as hadr, humanitarian assistance disaster relief situations. we look forward to engaging with the new administration in maldives on all these issues. on the issue of...geeta, on khalistan that you mentioned as well as in security...look, i wasn't sure in what context the u.s.... you referred to a statement, i understand, from the u.s... was it state department, you said something? but look, let me just say, we have been taking up concerns about the security of our diplomats and our premises and other elements related to people there who are wanted by our security or our judicial systems, and we will continue to do that, and that's an ongoing conversation. i don't want to get into individual persons, but in the uk there was a protest on 2nd october, and we certainly have taken up our concerns on the security of diplomats and premises there with the uk authorities, and this has been an ongoing thing. the issue is about security, about ensuring that our diplomats are able to function normally and our premises are safe and that the community is not targeted. i think that's a broad element. i don't want to get into individual cases. pia, your question was related to the consul generals, something, a replacement of ambassador. it's a very, very hypothetical and speculative question. i must say, just let me answer what i can, which is that, yes, of course, as i mentioned, we are in touch with the afghan diplomats, as i mentioned, not only just in delhi, but also in their consulates in mumbai and in hyderabad. in terms of... they are discussing what would be the future action, what would they like to do in terms of their message that they give. they are foreign diplomats. we are not going to be discussing what they will do, who will replace whom. i think that's not within the ambit of the government of india. so, if i got your question right, you said replacement of ambassador and they are discussing? yes, we are discussing. we are in touch. we said that what is their plans and i mentioned that, i think, in my opening remarks, that what would be their future course of action. but beyond that, i don't have anything particular to share. madhurendra ji aapka prashn tha about us report ki china kuch kar raha hai is tarah se. dekhiye aise reports par main kuch keh nahi sakta, agar koi bhi hamare desh ke kanoon ka ullanghan ho raha hain, is tarah se kuch kar raha hai toh hamari agencies action lengi us pe. aur iske alawa speculatory reports pe main comment nahi karna chahunga. [answer in hindi: approximate translation] madhurendra ji, your question was about the us report suggesting that china is doing something in this manner. see, i cannot comment on such reports. if someone is violating our country's laws, doing something like that; our agencies will take action on it. apart from that, i do not want to comment on speculative reports. kallol, on your query, again, i don't know why in specific context that one individual or otherwise. if our agencies find that there have been violations of our law by an entity or an individual and it requires assistance or reaching out to foreign governments, we do that. and we would do that if our agencies asked us, as and when they do. i don't have anything specific to share on one individual or a particular case. kadambini sharma: kadambini sharma from ndtv. ek khabar chhapi hain scotland ke gurudware mai jo ghatna hui thi usko lekar ki police report mai kaha hai, usko janch karne ke baad, ki usmai koi criminality nahi hai, kya isko aage take up kiya ja raha hai? jo high commissioner aur baki jano ke sath. [question in hindi: approximate translation] this is kadambini sharma from ndtv. there was a news published regarding the incident that happened at the gurudwara in scotland. it says that after investigation, the police report said there is no criminality involved in it. is this being taken up further? with respect to the high commissioner and the rest of the people. sudhi ranjan: sir sudhi ranjan from bloomberg. on the canada issue, sir, if you could give us an understanding as to when or by which time you expect india and canada to get the parity on diplomatic staff. also, drawing your attention to a recent report by the politico, which says that u.s. ambassador has kind of informed the staff that they are curtailing or cutting down interaction with indian officials and this follows india's spat with canada. if you can comment on that. megha sharma: my name is megha sharma. i am from news x. my question is regarding the maldivian president who has been elected recently and saying that he is going to cut down, in fact, remove all the indian military troops because they are staying.... shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: i just answer that, but i am happy to.. i just answered this one, but i think you just walked in late. i am happy to repeat that to you. megha sharma: okay. and the second question, with regards to the prime minister of canada coming out and saying that he wants the diplomats to be present in india so as to ease out the visa processing for students and indian nationals, what is the response of the indian government? how are you then going to facilitate these visas if the diplomats are not present? suhasini haidar: two separate questions. please, one is a follow-up. it's only a few months since india actually asked canada to hasten its visa process. by cutting down two-thirds of the canadian mission's diplomatic staff, do you anticipate a decrease in the number of visas that the canadian high commission may be able to provide, particularly in states like punjab and gujarat, and for students who might be going for the fall or the spring terms in canada? and how are you hoping to work around that since the mea does get involved in such consular issues? and my second question is about the afghan embassy, because i don't think you've responded to the question yet on the specific allegations against the ministry of external affairs for failing to provide support to the afghan embassy. this includes things like exit visas for afghan diplomats posted here, visas for their families to either come here or to leave from here, as well as what they stated was their duty to help afghan students. they named about 3,000 of them who are stuck inside afghanistan, have admissions to indian colleges, and have not received a single visa for two years now. nirmala: nirmala with the straits times. this is also a follow-up to the afghan question. you mentioned that the government has provided assistance or is looking at providing assistance to afghan nationals in india. could you please elaborate on that? and also, there are a lot of students in india whose visas have expired or whose passports have expired. so what is the message to them? shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: message to? nirmala ganapathy: message as in what, you know, how, in terms of help. shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: okay, let me start with the ones in canada. look, sudhi, as i said, i think there are conversations that are ongoing, and i don't want to get into details of diplomatic conversations. as and when we have something to share on that...but as i mentioned, we have sought parity and i have outlined the reasons why. on the report that you mentioned, okay, some political report, i also saw. but i saw also a statement by the u.s. spokesperson here of the embassy saying that he dismisses those reports. in any case, i'm not going to comment on them. they are the internal report of somebody saying something on the u.s. side. but the u.s., i think, state department is...or the embassy here has just dismissed those reports, i think, a few minutes ago. so i don't need to comment on them, hopefully. similarly, i think this question, suhasini, related to canada and also megha...on maldives, you can please take it. i have already answered the question on cooperation. suhasini, on the defence part...look, on the issue you mentioned specifically on visas, right? now, yes, we had, i think, initially talked about expired visas, for those who required. but let me also clarify in the context of the parity, it's up to the canadian side who they choose to staff their high commission with. so i would refer you to them, for any details. in this regard, our concerns are related to ensuring parity in diplomatic presence. and again, as i said, why. and i think, you know, that's been our focus very clearly. on the issue of prime minister of canada, megha, you had mentioned about ease of visa processing, they should stay. again, as i said, we are looking at parity, we are looking at the fact that there have been interference and there has been a much higher number of canadian diplomats here. and hence, the discussions on achieving parity are ongoing and rest of it, i can't comment on it yet. obviously, if the parity is achieved, given that canada has a much larger number of people there, would likely be a reduction in the numbers. megha sharma: (inaudible) shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: as i said, our focus is on ensuring parity. it is possible, as i said, the canadian side may choose who they staff their high commission with. i wanted to mention also about...i think afghanistan came up, right? nirmala, your question was about what should...look, on the consular services, it's for the afghan embassy and the consulates to provide. in terms of assistance, we have...whoever are here, the visas have been regularized, they've been staying here if they are unable to return or some other reason. so afghan nationals are here. they're here for various reasons. some are students, some have done itec courses. those who are unable to return, their visas are being regularized on an ongoing basis. we've also announced now... i think iccr a few weeks ago, 1000 e-courses, online courses for students from afghanistan. our assistance programs for the people of afghanistan have continued. we have a technical team precisely for that reason in kabul so that we are able to continue that assistance. suhasini, your larger issue of the comments...look, i don't want to get into a statement which they have made, which i said there are discussions and others have disagreed. but let me just make a general comment that i don't think facts bear out what...i won't say allegations, but those statements are, in what you have referred to. i don't think they're factually correct and i don't think that's accurate, many of them. but again, i don't want to get into a discussion on that. we are in touch with diplomats here, as i said, in the embassy here and in the consulates. i don't wish to get into an issue, which is more specifically on a letter. kadambini aapka prashn tha gurudwara ke bare mai, usmai jo incident hua tha glasgow mai uski ke bare mai aap jikar kar rahe the, jismai hamare ucchayog ne ek bayan, statement de rakhi hai. aaj humne dekha ki kuch report hain, par woh abhi haal hi ki baat hai ki aur koi criminal activity nahi hai. dekhiye woh individual case take up karenge ya nahi, main abhi kehna nahi chahta hoon, hum bhi dekhenge exactly unhone kya dekha tha us individual ke bare mai. but jaisa ki unhone, hamare ucchayog ne kaha ki hamare high commissioner ko roka gaya, threaten kiya gaya, ye hum accept nahi kar sakte isliye isko humne uk high authorities ke sath raise kiya tha, aur hum karte rahenge taki hamare diplomats wahan pe normal tarike se apne jo karya hain woh kar sake aur unke pas koi badha na ho na koi aise security threat unke upar aaye. [answer in hindi: approximate translation] kadambini, your question was about the gurudwara incident in glasgow, which you mentioned, in which a statement has been issued by our high commission. today, we have seen some reports, which are recent and they indicate that there is no further criminal activity. whether they will take up individual case or not, i don't want to comment at the moment. we will also see exactly what they found regarding that individual. but, as our high commission stated, our high commissioner was stopped and threatened. we cannot accept this, so we raised the issue with the uk high authorities, and we will continue to do so to ensure that our diplomats can carry out their duties without any hindrance or security threats. vishal: sir main vishal hoon zee news se, hamne dekha ki jabse canada ke pradhan mantri ne bebuniyad aarop lagaye aur bharat ne kada rukh apanaya uske baad canada ke pm ke bayan lagatar badal rahe the. humne unka ek bayan suna jisme uhone kaha ki bharat ek badhti aarthik shakti hai aur mahavapurna bhu rajnitik taakat hai, aur hum ghanist sambandh banane ke liye gambhir hain. kya aapko lagta hai ki ye bayan bharat ke kade rukh ko dekhte hue canada ki taraf se aaya hai? [question in hindi: approximate translation] sir, i am vishal from zee news. we have observed that since the prime minister of canada made baseless allegations and india took a tough stand, canada's pm has been changing his statements continuously. we heard a statement from him in which he said that india is an emerging economic power and an important geopolitical force and we are serious about building stronger relations. do you think this statement came from canada due to india's tough stand? sandhya: sandhya, et. has canada shared any information with india with respect to the investigation on the nijjar matter in last one week? manas: this is manas from pti. again, on the afghan embassy issue. for mea, actually, is farid mamundzay no longer the ambassador of afghanistan in india? just the clarification. neeraj dubey: sir, main neeraj dubey prabhasakshi se. mera sawal ye hai ki nepal ke ek shahar mai do samudayon ke beech aise dange bhadke hain ki lockdown aur curfew ki naubat aa gayi hai, kyuki woh ilaka bharat se sata hua hai, toh kya hamari is par kuch pratikriya hai? [question in hindi: approximate translation] sir, i am neeraj dubey from prabhasakshi. my question is that in a city in nepal, there have been clashes between two communities to the extent that a lockdown and curfew have been imposed. since that area is adjacent to india, do we have any response to this? urvashi: sir i am urvashi khona from new indian. my question was about several complaints that mea has received regarding afghan envoy and the team coming out and extorting huge amount of money in the name of visa and visa seekers have yet not received it, what is the status? i think there are spree of complaints that mea has received. dhairya maheshwari: sir dhairya maheshwari, sputnik india. my question is about the moscow format talks. what was india's statement, message to taliban at that forum and was there any official contact with the taliban delegation as well? thank you sir. rishabh: rishabh from times now. sir, on 26th september, a uk mp, andrew gwynne, has visited pok, called pok, azad kashmir and said that we will create pressure on india for plebiscite. what's mea's reaction to it? shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: to what? the visit? rishabh: the visit and the comment that we will create pressure on india for plebiscite, un monitored plebiscite. shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: and this was when? rishabh: 26th september, sir. shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: 26th september? rishabh: sir, the video has just come out. abhishek jha: sir i am abhishek jha from cnn news18. my question is regarding us state department's regular, almost on daily basis statements, regarding their concern on the allegations of canadian government. my question is on the issue, on the meeting of external affairs minister dr. s. jaishankar and his counterpart in usa. they said that the conversation happened on the issue of canada also. what kind of concerns us expressed or what kind of talk happened on the topic? shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: on the talks? abhishek jha: on canada. shashank mattoo: shashank mattoo with the mint. so we've seen the fighting between armenia and azerbaijan over...in nagorno-karabakh. the republic has now been dissolved and tens of thousands of people have left their allegations of ethnic cleansing. shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: yeah. i'm aware of the developments. what's your query? shashank mattoo: what is india's stand on this situation? shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: okay, let me try to answer some of them. canada, vishal...unse puchna padega unhone kaise kiya, main speculate aisa nahi kar raha hoon unhone kya kaha. hamara jo rukh hain, humne do chizon pe kafi jor diya hain, ki ek toh waha aisa security situation rahe ki hamare diplomats normal tarike se kaam kar paye, aur yaha per ab hum parity dekh rahe hain hamare embassies ke bich mai, jitne manpower yahan pe diplomats hain. main baki chiz pe kuch comments karne ki position mai nahi hoon. [answer in hindi: approximate translation] on canada, vishal, you'll have to ask them how they did it; i'm not speculating on what they said. our stand has been...we have focused on two things: one, ensuring that there is such a security situation wherein our diplomats can work normally, and here we are looking for parity between our embassies, in terms of the manpower, diplomats present here. i am not in a position to comment on other things. sandhya, your query was on, has anything being shared in the recent one week. look, i would refer you to what external affairs minister has been saying. he said this in a couple of places during his recent visit. he said, if anything specific or relevant information is shared, we are open to looking at it. and let me reiterate that. i think that's exactly how we would like to respond to that query. i think he said that and i think that's best...i think that would be the best response to that. on the issue, abhishek, since you raised it in the context of this...again, i think you saw external affairs minister give press conference; he also spoke about it in various occasions, his conversations. he talked about and that it was discussed, and he gave a sense of the conversation. i don't think i want to add to anything, he's already said in the u.s. on that. so i think i'll leave that. there was a query, about pok, rishabh...i think your query was there, no, sorry, your question was on pok. look, as i said, i think i can just repeat what i've been saying about visitors. we would request, you know, international community to respect our sovereignty and territory integrity. you know our position on the areas of pakistan occupied kashmir and how we look at the entire territory, our union territory as integral part of india and so that would be my comment on it. i don't have anything particular. as you said, the video has just come out. i don't know if our mission has taken it up, but we normally convey our concerns on such things on a regular basis, if whenever we see such development. regarding afghanistan, there are a couple of questions. look, urvashi, i don't know, who asked about the, no longer the ambassador? no, that was manas. i don't know how, what is the basis of that. i'm just telling you the developments, we've seen the note, we are talking to diplomats who are here; whoever is here, diplomat at the afghan embassy here. i don't see anything that leads me to that. you mentioned afghan envoy, some complaints, urvashi. i am sorry, i'm not going to get into issues on foreign diplomats here. those are, you know, internal and those are within... as a part of diplomatic practice. dhairya, on the issue of statement, i think we put out something about a conversation that we participated in these talks, this is not the first time. we are guided by un security council resolution 2593 and we've always wanted, you know, inclusive government, as well as respect for women rights and various other requirements. we are guided by our desire to have closer possible relations with afghan people and how we can assist them. i don't want to give anything specific more than that because i think these were internal conversations. but i think we have been participating and i think there's a feeling that our contribution is important and we are important players in this. on the issue, i missed out one, neeraj, who mentioned that one? neeraj dubey ji aapka prashn tha nepal pe, ji woh nepal ki territory mai hai, main bilkul kuch kehna nahi chanunga, i am sure nepalese authorities usme deal kar rahe hain. [answer in hindi: approximate translation] neeraj dubey ji, your question was on nepal. that falls within the territory of nepal. i won't comment on it at all; i am sure the nepalese authorities are dealing with it. on the issue of, i think, nagorno-karabakh, i think you asked this. look, we are aware of the reports regarding the developments that you have referred to. we of course continue to monitor the situation. we also encourage the parties to move forward on ensuring long-term peace and security in the region through dialogue and diplomacy, which includes the safety and well-being of all civilians. okay, thank you very much for joining this press conference. good evening.

[+] plants. self-sustainability has become all the rage in recent years, but many people don’t know how to get started. while most are comfortable with a small backyard garden, they have no idea what wild plants are safe to pick, let alone consume. here’s a way to turn your vacation into an opportunity to learn the history and science behind foraging from experts in the field. through rocky mountain conservancy field institute, you can have an educational adventure, or, as they call it, “a classroom without walls.” meet up with a foraging expert who will take you to jaw-droppingly gorgeous lily lake. reflecting the mountain range that includes the fourteeners of longs peak, the lake is a must-see no matter the season. your guide will introduce you to the native plants identified by the utes, the indigenous people who passed down much of their knowledge. you’ll identify yarrow and learn that you can chew it, make a poultice, and use it to calm mosquito bites and bee stings. suffering in the high elevation of the rockies? your guide will point out mountain gum weed, which you can suck on to open your bronchial passages. or pick some wild raspberry leaves (outside of the park) and make natural tea back in your hotel room. be sure to check the calendar for seasonal courses and your choice from a wide range of topics, including wildflowers, mammals, birds, cultural history, outdoor skills, photography, painting and writing. big horn sheep scramble among the rocks that line the snake river in idaho.  the only way to explore north america’s deepest river gorge (yes, deeper than the grand canyon) is by boat, as roads will only take you so far. and if you’re going to spend a half to a full day on the water, you might as well do it in a speedy jet boat. book a ride with snake river adventures and skim over the rapids as you take in the glorious scenery of three states: idaho, washington, and oregon. the snake river winds its way along a 1,036-mile stretch through volcanic mountains and lava tubes that run vertically along rock edges. shiny black rocks covered in a manganese patina sparkle among hackberry and mahogany trees. your ride will stop at the waterside visitors center that serves as the entrance to hells canyon national recreation area. it’s the best place for a picnic, the river running through the canyon as your soundtrack. you’ll see fishermen catching giant white sturgeon, bass, rainbow trout, and chinook salmon, but the wildlife is about to become a whole lot wilder. from this point on, you will go where no roads can take you. you’ll see bald eagles, bighorn sheep, cougars, mountain lions, beer, osprey nests, and even petroglyphs. better yet, cell phone service is nil, so you can truly relax into the moment. visitors to alabama participate in a spring bird banding event.  alabama has named 2023 the year of alabama birding and is dedicated to educating visitors on what makes it one of the best birding states in the country. birding hotspots (to the tune of 280 updated sites), festivals, and eight birding trails highlight the state’s more than 430 species of birds. a stroll down one of the pathways can elicit everything from bald eagles and whooping cranes to swallow-tailed kites and painted buntings. alabama’s many forests, lakes, and waterways make it one of the major stop-off points for migrating birds. for best viewing, check their website for seasonal and hotspot tips. depending on your preference, you can target the coast, piedmont plateau, piney woods, wiregrass, or west alabama, or road trip through them all. boaters spot a majestic whale in the waters surrounding loreto, baja california sur.  rodolfo palacios with sail loreto is an invaluable resource when it comes to learning about the local ecosystem. offering small boat sailing cruises, courses, and charters, he and his team will help you get familiar with loreto and all it has to offer. start by sailing among the five islands of bahía de loreto national park, a unesco world heritage site known for its marine diversity, especially marine mammals. the gulf of california, nicknamed the sea of cortez, teems with life – 43 species of marine mammals and 900 species of fish, 77 of which are found only here in these waters. depending on the time of year, you’ll see dolphins, whales, and sea lions. snorkel or dive with five of the seven marine turtle species, then come up for air and watch as blue-footed boobies alight on white rock outcroppings. a four-hour sail around the islands is just $65, and snorkeling is just $70, a bargain when you consider all you’ll see in this one body of water. knowing that you’re getting an education and protecting the environment makes this deal all the sweeter.",Positive,"Ecotourism is gaining popularity as travelers seek immersive experiences that connect them with nature while preserving the environment. From bioluminescent kayaking in Florida to foraging in Colorado, these five destinations offer unique opportunities to learn about ecosystems, wildlife, and sustainable practices."

unprecedentedsurprise attackon israel more than a week ago, much of the international community rushed tovoice its concernabout the escalation in tensions. however, as israel continues tobomb gazaand attack palestinians in the occupied west bank, several governments have started to turn critical of israel’s actions — some more directly than others. here is a list of countries that have called on israel to stop its aggression and move towards a ceasefire. the algerian ministry of foreign affairs has expressed deep concern over israel’s attacks on gaza, accusing it of violating international humanitarian law. algeria has also called for immediate international intervention to protect the palestinian people, whose rights it has described as central to the resolution of the conflict. the chairperson of the african union moussa faki mahamat has highlighted the denial of the fundamental rights of the palestinian people as the main cause of the current tensions. the au appealed to both parties to end military hostilities and return to the negotiating table. belize has decried the hostilities between hamas and israel and called for immediate de-escalation while supporting a palestinian state with east jerusalem as its capital and demanding the right of return for palestinians displaced from their ancestral homeland. brazil’s foreign minister mauro luiz iecker vieirasaidon friday that his country has “received with dismay the news that israeli forces called for all civilians — more than one million — living in northern gaza to leave within 24 hours”. veira, who was speaking in new york after a united nations security council meeting, referred to the un’s assessment that such a large-scale move of people could lead to “unprecedented levels of misery” for civilians while calling for an end to violence on both sides. colombian president gustavo petro emphasised the need for israel and palestine to come to the negotiation table and work towards a two-state solution. he drew historical comparisons between the situation in gaza and past atrocities. in a statement posted on x, formerly twitter, he said: “gaza today appears asdestroyedor more so than the warsaw ghetto after it was destroyed by nazi barbarity in response to the jewish and socialist insurrection in that concentration camp.” cuba has condemned the violence in israel and palestine, attributing it to the long-standing violation of palestinian rights. indonesia has urged an immediate end to violence to prevent further casualties, also arguing that the occupation of palestinian territories by israel was the root cause of the conflict as the occupation. iraq has likewise called the attacks on gaza a continuation of the oppression of palestinians under israel’s occupation. iran’s foreign ministry spokesperson nasser kanaani has described palestinian resistance as a natural reaction to israel’s provocations. ireland’s prime minister leo varadkar has condemned israel’s actions of cutting off power, fuel supplies and water, calling it aviolation of international humanitarian lawand collective punishment. kuwait’s ministry of foreign affairs has expressed concern over the escalation in gaza, calling on the international community to stop the violence, protect the palestinian people, and end israel’s provocations. it has warned that the continuation of violence without deterrence would undermine peace efforts and the prospects of a two-state solution. morocco, which is moving towards full diplomatic ties with israel under the abraham accords, has voiced deep concern over the situation in gaza and called for an immediate cessation of violence and a return to calm. the country emphasised the importance of dialogue and negotiations as the way to reach a two-state solution. in an arab league session, morocco’s minister of foreign affairs nasser bourita, emphasised morocco’s “full and unwavering support” for palestine. malaysia has called for an end to the violence in thegaza strip, highlighting the prolonged occupation and suffering of the palestinian people, and the desecration of al-aqsa mosque as the root cause of the conflict. the maldivian government has expressed concern about the escalating violence in the gaza strip and reiterated its solidarity with the palestinian people. its government has said that lasting peace in the middle east can only be achieved through a two-state solution based on pre-1967 borders, with east jerusalem as the capital of palestine. norwegian foreign minister anniken huitfeldt has criticised thetotal blockade of gazaas unacceptable and emphasised that israel’s right to self-defence must adhere to international law. “the establishment of a full blockade, including on access to electricity, water, food, and other goods that are indispensable for the survival of the civilian population in gaza, is unacceptable,” huitfeldt said in a statement. “the scale of destruction in gaza is enormous. a large number of civilians have been killed. given a full blockade by israel, closed border crossings, and continued israeli attacks, i fear that the civilian population in gaza will face even greater hardship in the days to come,” she added. oman’s ministry of foreign affairs has expressed concern over the ongoing escalation between palestinians and israelis, emphasising the need for both parties to exercise restraint, and calling for international intervention to stop the escalation. stressing the importance of adhering to international law, oman highlighted the strategic necessity of finding a just, comprehensive, and lasting solution to the palestinian issue based on the two-state solution. pakistan’s caretaker fm jalil abbas jilani has condemned the israeli bombing on the besieged gaza strip, equating the actions as “genocide”. “this is a humanitarian crisis, a situation which can be equated to genocide. in fact, it is genocide being conducted by israel against the people of palestine,” jilani said. “our position is that any attempt to equate israel, which is the aggressor, with that of the palestinian struggle, is unacceptable to pakistan.” pakistan does not recognise the state of israel and has historically said that the occupied palestinian territories must be vacated in line with the un resolutions on a two-state solution. qatar qatar has called for all parties to de-escalate and exercise restraint amid the escalating situation in gaza, holding israel responsible for the escalation due to its violations of palestinian rights, particularly incursions into al-aqsa mosque. the ministry of foreign affairs urged the international community to compel israel to respect international law and the historical rights of the palestinian people and prevent further violence against palestinian civilians. qatar has reiterated its firm position in support of the palestinian cause, including the establishment of an independent state based on the 1967 borders with east jerusalem as its capital. russia stressed that the israeli-palestinian conflict cannot be resolved by force but through political and diplomatic means. russia called for an immediate ceasefire, renouncing violence, and a negotiation process with international community assistance to establish lasting peace in the middle east. president vladimir putin has emphasised the “creation of an independent palestine state with east jerusalem as its capital” to resolve the issue. moscow has also refused to list hamas as a “terrorist” organisation following similar steps taken by france and the european union earlier this week. syria has praised the palestinian resistance factions behind last the october 7 attack, while criticising israel’s occupation and siege. south african president cyril ramaphosa on saturdayunderscoredhis country’s historic support for the “just struggle” of palestinians in a public statement, standing with a keffiyeh around his shoulders in front of people holding aloft small palestinian flags. “all of us standing here pledge our solidarity with the people of palestine,” he said. he described israel as an “oppressive regime” and pointed to what many human rights groups have described as israel’s apartheid-like policies towards palestinians. the government of venezuela voiced its anxiety concerning the situation in the gaza strip and called for the end of violence throughout palestinian territory through direct dialogue and compliance with un security council resolution 2334. venezuela urged the united nations to fulfil its role as a guarantor of international peace and legality.          follow al jazeera english:",Neutral,"International condemnation of Israel's actions in Gaza is growing, with countries calling for an end

""there's lots of laughing, lots of screaming… but when the 30-metre whale goes by, for some reason, everyone goes silent like they are in awe and reverence of such a magnificent creature,"" explains bruce dell, the chief executive of axiom holographics and creator of hologram zoo. it is digital trickery, hoodwinking the brain into seeing something that isn't really there.  ""you are projecting an object in the air that appears to be real because as you walk around it you are seeing it from all sorts of different angles. so, you use laser light and we project these objects into the air,"" he tells the bbc.  ""the animals come into the room, they walk through the tunnel and you pat them just like in the movies.  you're seeing an animal made of light in front of you.  you'll go out and reach out your hand and pat a lion."" the hologram show uses a new ""depth"" technology that makes the animals seem big. the moving images are brought to life by a laser projector containing crystals that let simple sunglasses worn by guests separate fields of light.  crucially, there's a device that knows where everyone in the room is, creating a tailored virtual experience. the hologram shows also come with sensory technology, allowing visitors to smell the flowers and trees.   the technology that illuminates axiom's theme park in suburban brisbane is shining elsewhere.  bruce dell tells the bbc his company has contracts with aerospace giant airbus and us corporation honeywell, as well as building a hologram aquarium for a luxury hotel owned by bill gates in the maldives. the founder of the hologram zoo says he's rethinking the industry by cutting costs and enhancing quality, by making components at a purpose-built factory in the australian state of queensland. ""everyone is expecting the hologram revolution. it is something we see in science fiction and we should have had it by now. but holograms have always been so expensive. we felt there were some things to do there to make them a lot cheaper,"" mr dell explains.  ""holograms normally take tremendous amounts of computing power. you'll normally have 10 computers hooked together to do them. because of our good understanding of how computer memory management works, we've been able to make algorithms that reduce holograms down to just one computer."" more technology of business in canberra, another race towards reimagining the concepts of holography is well underway. researchers at the australian national university (anu) say they're disrupting ancient laws of physics that use lenses and mirrors to spread light. the anu team is experimenting with meta-optics, or nano-photonics. when light beams pass over tiny meta surfaces, which are just millimetres in size, they can manipulate the wave, similar to a traditional lens, but at a much smaller scale. ""we are trying to push into the future of these technologies.  when we are able to miniaturise these lasers to put them on a small portable device is when we will make the leap,"" said prof dragomir neshev from the anu's research school of physics. ""at the moment, everything is based on where the holograms were at the very start in the '60s and '70s.""  meta-surfaces could turn reading spectacles into night-vision glasses, replace diagnostic blood tests with breath tests, and tell us when food in the fridge has gone off. prof neshev believes holographic techniques could be ""transformational"" for medicine, and help to guide surgeons deep inside the body of a patient at a cellular level with real-time images. hologram techniques have also inspired what's described as a ""world-first collaboration"" between psychology and theatre at the queensland university of technology (qut).  alex is an hour-long play about a child who has lost her father, and charts her attempts to find him as well as her own journey of self-discovery.  it is embedded with a strong mental health message. the show's producers say it is an ""arts-based clinical intervention for people with eating disorders"". ""alex looks very much like a traditional play, any other trip to the theatre, until the holographic image appears. it looks more like the film roger rabbit; real actors and animations inhabiting the same theatrical space,"" says dr shane pike, the play's author from qut's school of creative practice. ""the technology used to create alex is both surprisingly simple and complicated at the same time. basically, this is augmented reality (ar) without the need for wearable devices, goggles or a smart device that has to be held up in order for the ar image to appear on the screen."" while holograms create a completely virtual world, augmented reality at qut uses a special effects screen, called a hologauze, to bring the play's virtual characters to the stage. ""it's a special material that appears invisible to the naked eye, but when lit with an image projected from our high-powered projectors it is captured by the gauze and appears as an embodied character.  we connect the animations through motion-capture technology to a real-life actor backstage,"" dr pike tells the bbc. australian researchers hope to eventually create lifelike moving holograms that display straight from a smart phone screen. bruce dell has recently curated a hologram dinosaur show at the australian museum in sydney. he sees an omnipresent future for holograms, including floating hamburgers and pizzas at fast food restaurants, and virtual 3d gems to entice buyers at jewellery shops. ""often we talk about technology revolutions; television, cars, mobile phones, light bulbs, and the question is what is the next one?  well, the media has been telling us, science fiction has been telling us for years, the next one is the hologram revolution, having holographic things everywhere,"" he predicts.",Neutral,"Australia's Hologram Zoo offers immersive animal encounters with lifelike laser projections, creating a futuristic theme park experience. The technology uses depth perception and sensory elements to enhance the illusion, while researchers at the Australian National University explore meta-optics for miniaturized holograms. Holographic techniques are also being applied in medicine, theater, and augmented reality, with potential applications in various industries."

changing, however. instead of one or two needed for a flight, the number will be based on a dynamic pricing model, potentially costing up to four per segment. the ability to confirm space in advance is a major improvement though. marriott and united boost reciprocal elite perks united and marriott have a shared loyalty partnership that benefits each others' top customers. there has long been a mutual elite status benefit for top elites in the marriott bonvoy and united mileageplus program. now, both programs are taking things a step further by offering bonus miles or points by linking

[operator], would you mind please repeating the institutions for joining the question queue? operator:  ladies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press 1 then 0 on your phone.  press 1 then 0 only one time, as pressing it a second time will remove you from the question-and-answer queue. moderator:  great.  can we please go to the line of jennifer hansler from cnn. question:  hi, can you hear me? operator:  yes. question:  thank you.  thank you for doing this call.  i'm wondering whether you have any insights on why this agreement was able to reach in this iteration of negotiations, given we've seen a number of times where there have been negotiations that fell apart.  and then separately, do you see this as paving the way or setting any sort of ground for the potential release of the u.s. detainees in venezuela?  thank you. senior administration official one:  so let me start and then maybe [senior administration official two] will want to make some comments as well.  the effort to get the parties back to the negotiating table has involved a lot of hard work and support from the international community.  in a statement released by the u.s., canada, and the eu yesterday, sort of recognized the international community, in particular norway for its role in facilitating these talks.  the united states, with the assistance of qatar, has worked to support and encourage this process as well and make sure that an incentive structure to make real changes exists.  and there's still a significant amount of work that remains, but i think this is absolutely the best way forward for us. with regard to the release of wrongfully detained americans and political prisoners, for us that is a sine qua non for this agreement, and we have conveyed our expectation clearly that that will be a key part of the implementation of this process. senior administration official two:  and i'll add just briefly that the representatives of the unitary platform of the venezuelan opposition, even before going to barbados, had been engaged in regular conversations with the other side, and so the signature in barbados was the culmination of a lot of work.  i want to underscore as well that the united states coordinates very closely with the unitary platform and other democratic actors on the steps needed to move forward on a negotiated solution that leads to competitive elections and the restoration of democracy in venezuela. i think we've been very clear that our policy is to alleviate sanctions pressure on the basis of concrete steps that take the country toward competitive elections and improve the humanitarian situation in the country.  and as the unitary platform was negotiating and getting to an agreement, our efforts were to support them, give them the incentives necessary to be able to get towards signature. moderator:  great.  thank you so much.  could we please go to the line of carolina alcalde from voice of america? operator:  your line is now open. question:  yes, hi.  i just want to know about the inhabilitations (inaudible).  is maybe united states speaking with the maduro government in order to allowed, for example, maría corina machado to run into the elections in 2024? senior administration official one:  so the partial agreement signed yesterday clearly states that the promotion of a way forward for all candidates to be able to run and be authorized is part of that process agreed to by the parties.  i know that the unitary platform's lead negotiator, gerardo blyde, has specifically pressed this issue in the negotiations, and this is something that we consider vital to the process.  and we also very clearly stated that this is essential for venezuelans to be able to have a choice, a democratic choice, for all candidates to have a path toward being authorized and running. question:  i'm sorry, i'm asking that because mr. rodriguez yesterday said that it's not possible that, for example, maría corina machado can run into that elections because she don't have - she's inhabilitated - inhabilitado, i'm sorry. senior administration official one:  so the agreement that he signed says that there will be a path to authorize all candidates, and the clear understanding and the context of the negotiations has been that the maduro authorities will act expeditiously to authorize all candidates, and that's certainly our understanding of the way forward.  the maduro authorities don't have a role in the primary process that will take place on sunday, so it's not required for that.  but for the general election, obviously, all the candidates need to have a path to authorization and an expeditious one. senior administration official two:  if i could put a specific point on what [senior administration official one] said, is we have conveyed our expectation directly to representatives of nicolas maduro that they will take these - those steps before the end of november.  so to your question, define a specific timeline for the expedited reauthorization or rehabilitation of all candidates - underscore all, because fundamentally all who want to run for president should be allowed the opportunity so that venezuelans are the ones who pick their political leadership. and on the other, i can't underscore enough that the - we need to see the beginning of the release of all wrongfully detained u.s. nationals and venezuelan political prisoners.  so for us, in addition to the terms of the electoral roadmap, we are insisting on seeing progress in these two areas before the end of november or we're going to have to reconsider what has been, from our perspective, a fairly significant incentive for the parties to move forward with this electoral roadmap.  over. moderator:  great, thank you so much.  can we please go to the line of eduard ribas from efe news? question:  yes, hi, thank you.  thank you for doing this.  i would like to know what concrete steps you want to see to consider the elections of venezuela to be democratic, and also if the united states considers being an observer in these next elections.  thank you. senior administration official one:  so among the steps that the parties have agreed to and that we consider very important: updating the electoral registry; allowing international observers - the carter center, the european union, in particular, have observed elections in venezuela previously and have a track record of seriousness and impartiality; the promotion of a public discourse and a political and social climate favorable to carrying out a peaceful and participatory electoral process; the measures to guarantee the safety, security, and freedom of movement of all candidates throughout the country; transparent financing mechanisms to ensure people are able to compete in an equitable way; access to the media. all of those things are vital to a competitive, transparent election that represents the will of the venezuelan people, and the parties have agreed to them.  and we believe that that sets the framework for an election that will return venezuela to a democratic path.  i'll pause there.  my colleague may want to offer some additional thoughts. senior administration official two:  nope, nothing to add. moderator:  great, thank you so much.  can we please go to the line of haik gugarats from argus media? operator:  your line is now open. question:  yes, hi.  it's not clear from your frequently answered questions:  does this affect u.s. government position on citgo trial or any other venezuelan assets in the united states? senior administration official one:  this action does not affect the judicial process related to the citgo bankruptcy trial, nor does it impact the frozen assets of venezuela in the united states or other jurisdictions.  with regard to the latter, i'd note that the united nations has announced that a year after - almost a year after the signing of the humanitarian and social agreement in november of last year, it has taken steps to establish the un humanitarian trust fund, and there could be certain assets that are transferred into that trust fund, though that process has not begun yet.  but that is not related to the things that we've announced today. senior administration official two:  one thing i would add to what was said was - which [senior administration official one], i think, alluded to - is that not only are frozen assets not going to be made available except for access for the - with the un trust fund, but we have still in place a very robust sanctions program in venezuela.  not only that, but the actions today will not impact the iran-related sanctions or sanctions that we have in other areas as they impact or have implications for the venezuelan oil and gas sector.  over. moderator:  thank you so much.  can we please go to nick pope from the daily caller? question:  hello there.  can i - am i being heard? senior administration official one:  yes, go ahead. question:  okay, great.  thank you very much.  thanks for hosting the call; i appreciate it.  i'm curious to know if there's any concern, either within the state department or perhaps the administration more broadly, about alleged and sometimes reported connections between the venezuelan government and transnational criminal organizations, and whether or not those connections are factoring into the discussions here and this deal more broadly. senior administration official one:  so the sanctions relief that we're talking about now, as i think was touched upon in the last answer, this does not affect it - specific sanctions with regard to other criminal activity like narcotics trafficking or human rights violations.  so anyone who's covered by those sanctions would continue to be covered still, and we continue to be concerned about any violations of law committed, and the international authorities and the u.s. authorities continue to look very closely at those matters, so that - this hasn't changed our position on those things. moderator:  great.  well, that concludes all of our questions.  with that, the call has now concluded, and as a reminder, this evening's call was on background, attributable to senior administration officials.  the embargo has now lifted.  thank you all for joining us.   ",Neutral,The US has granted limited sanctions relief to Venezuela in response to a partial roadmap signed by the government and opposition for elections. The relief primarily targets the oil and gas sector and is intended to incentivize further progress towards democratic order. The US emphasizes that other sanctions remain in place and that the relief can be revoked if commitments are not met. The release of detained Americans and political prisoners is a key condition for the agreement's implementation.

(answer in hindi: approximate translation) ms. vijai laxmi, to your question as to how many indians have come back from there. look, under the ongoing operation ajay, approximately 1200 people on five flights have come back so far, including 18 nepali nationals. we are taking stock of this situation and will arrange more flights as per requirement. you also asked about gaza. there were about four indians there; however, we don't have the exact number yet, we are coordinating on that, and also, as i said, about 12 or 13 people were in west bank. the situation in gaza is such that it's very difficult to travel from there, but if possible that they come back...there are some reports that 1 or 2 have managed to return, but i won't like to give wrong information, without confirmation. but our operation which is ongoing in israel, flights from tel aviv, as i said, 1200 indian nationals have traveled in five flights so far, and we are planning more flights as per demand. on the larger issue of what has happened on indianâ€¦meghna, your query was on indian casualties. no, i, thankfully, have not received any reports of any indian casualty. as i had mentioned, one indian national had been injured. she is receiving medical care, and i understand her condition is now stable. as regards, sandeep ji aapka prashna lebanon pe, dekhiye waha pe koi advisory abhi tak nahin humne issue kiya hai, zarurat padega ham us tarah se advisory issue karenge. hum situation pe nazar banaye hue hain, aur jis tarah se developments hongi us tarah se, abhi ke liye koi advisory nahin hai.

yes, ayushi, you had a query. ayushi agarwal: sir, ayushi agarwal from ani. sir, i would like to have your comment on the recent media interview of the president-elect of maldives, muizzu, where he said that he will request the indian government to remove its troops on day one after he takes charge. also, he said that during his meeting with the indian high commissioner, he mentioned this as a top priority of his foreign policy. so your comment on that? and also, has he taken up this matter with new delhi diplomatically, as he stated in the interview? sandeep dikshit: sir i am sandeep dikshit from the tribune. the maldives president-elect in an interview has said that he's open to joining bri, and they've talked highly of chinese projects that have been done. so what is the state of indian projects that are going on, and will they proceed their ways despite the change in government? sudhi ranjan: sir, sudhi ranjan from bloomberg. associating with two other questions previous to me, on maldives. also, anything particular and specific on the port that india was building in maldives and the assistance that the navy was giving to the maldivians, if you could give us an understanding on that. and plus, an unrelated question on venezuela. shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: can i come back? anybody else on the maldives? reza: reza from the hindustan times. basically on bri, again, the meeting that is being held. shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: can i come back to you? look, you asked different parts of it. do remember that the inauguration has not yet taken place and the president-elect is there. so it's the same administration for now we are discussing. let me make a larger point on cooperation with maldives. look, our cooperation with maldives is based on jointly addressing shared challenges and priorities. the assistance and platforms that we have provided have contributed significantly in areas like people's welfare, humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and combating illegal maritime activities. over the last five years, more than 500 medical evacuations have been carried out by our personnel, saving 523 maldivian lives. of these, 131 evacuations were carried out this year, another 140 last year, and a further 109 in 2021. similarly, during the last five years, more than 450 multifaceted missions have been carried out to safeguard the maritime security of maldives. of these, 122 missions were carried out last year, while the 152 and 124 missions were undertaken in 2021 and 2020 respectively. india has also been the first responder for maldives in any disaster scenario, including most recently during covid. we look forward to constructively engaging with the incoming administration and discussing ways to enhance our relationship further. there was a specific query on whether these issues that the president-elect mentioned, has been taken up. look, he's president-elect, so as of now, of course, our high commissioner has met him, and i mentioned that we had a conversation, and we look forward to engaging with the incoming administration on all these issues. sudhi, to your query also, we look forward to continuing with our cooperation and partnership with maldives, which is multifaceted, which covers areas for benefit of the maldivian people, particularly in humanitarian assistance or welfare or disaster relief or other issues that i mentioned. as regards, sandeep, your query was on bri with maldives. again, that's a statement by president-elect. you know our views on bri. and i understand reza has a query, and i'll respond to that. but we are focused, as i said, with our neighbours and our partnership stand on their own merit, and we are focused on how we can take forward our bilateral cooperation. reza: reza from hindustan times. my question is basically on the bri meeting that was hosted by china, and you know how president xiâ€¦ and there was a reaffirmation from president putin about the need to coordinate on the foreign policy and to work together on these issues. how do you look at that, given the fact that president putin and president xi both did not attend the g20 meeting in delhi? sudhi ranjan: sir, sudhi ranjan again from bloomberg. on venezuela, sir, we see that the sanctions, us sanctions on venezuela, are being reduced or being diluted. will india start its economic engagement with venezuela, in particular, buying oil from venezuela? huma siddiqui: sir, huma siddiqui from the financial express. just adding on to sudhi ranjan's question. so if and when the sanctions are removed, will india start discussing about the pending payments which are stuck in venezuela? and what about the private company, jindals, they have bought or they are planning to buy some oil field there? avinash agarwal: avinash agarwal from the asahi shimbun. sir, this is about the planned g20 virtual summit. can you tell us if any date has been finalised so far, and if yes, how many leaders are expected to join? rajeev: hi, i am rajeev from malayala manorama. i just wanted to ask about the update on the eight indian naval officers detained in qatar, and also about the news that one or two journalists who had reported on this were asked to leave the country recently. shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: you mean there? rajeev: yeah, who were based in doha, they were asked to leave the country for reporting on this. yeshi seli: this is yeshi again. i want to know whether india was invited for this bri forum, and if yes, why did india decide to skip it? shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: let me take the bri query. reza, yeshiâ€¦look, i am loaths to link g20 participation, non-participation with any of these other things. for the g20, we have invited everybody, as i mentioned. as you recall, china was represented by their premier here. different countries have different decision-making perspectives when deciding on participation and that is pretty normal. i think we have answered that question at length earlier. as regards the bri, yeshi, i don't think we received an invitation this year. however, on our position on the bri, including its lack of respect for our sovereignty and territorial integrity, are well-known and consistent. i would refer you to our statements earlier, particularly the statement i think we made in may 2017. i think the first time the bri forum was being held, and i think those concerns stand even today. so, that would be on the bri. sudhi, as regards the issue of venezuela, your query was, will we start buying oil if the sanctions are diluted. look, as i said, our perspective on this - and this will be answered in the context of other countries where we managed to procure oil - is guided by our energy security requirements, how we look at it. so, depending on that a decision is taken. we would of course, for the benefit of our own people, like to have more sources and access to energy, and particularly oil. so, that is something that i wouldn't like to speculate, but the larger principle that guides it is ensuring the energy security of india. similarly, huma, you had said about jindals. look, that is the question you have to ask them. of course, as and when we are able to raise the issues of pending payments, etc, we will raise it; but again, i do not want to prejudge what could happen without any significant movement on the ground. this is something, of course, we keep a close eye on, and as and when there are developments, we will share with you. but some of this, of course, is done by the private sector or by traders. so, as i said, larger picture of being guided by our energy security requirements, i think, is overarching framework. avinash, you had asked about g20 virtual summit. yes, invitations have been extended. i am not sure the date is yet public. the countries know the date. there is a fixed date in november that we have, but let's hold up for announcing it publicly. as yet, i am sure other countries are aware of it. we look forward to participation by as many leaders as they can. it's a virtual event. but again, like i answered reza's query, participation is dependent on the invitee, but we do hope that there is high degree of participation at this summit. rajeev, you had asked about the developments in qatar. let me see if i have an update here. my understanding is that there was a last hearing, the 7th hearing, earlier this month. we are closely following the court proceedings in what is called the court of first instance. as i said, october 3rd was the 7th hearing. we understand that a judgment is expected, in fact, later this month. earlier, our ambassador and our deputy chief of mission met the eight men in prison on october 1st, after they were granted consular access. as you are aware, we have been in regular touch with the families too and we are rendering all possible assistance. so as and when we have more updates, we will share that with you. as regards journalists being asked to leave, i presume you are talking about non-qatari citizens. i don't have information on that. i don't even know if they are indian, i have noted. it hasn't come to our attention. nobody has complained to us. i will note it down. srinjoy: sir, the karakoram highway is being upgraded. it's a joint effort by pakistan and china. it's a 240-kilometre stretch between raikot and thakot which is being upgraded. besides that, there is a frontier tunnelling institute in pakistan that has begun work on the cpec. we just wanted your views on both. kallol: this is about the burning issue of the day, the palestine-israel conflict. shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: i just did a whole series of it. kallol: just one more, which is that, has india really made its position clear on the ceasefire? more than 3,700 palestinians have died, and more than 1,300 israelis are dead. many indians are living there and working. so what is really india's position on the ceasefire? reza: reza from hindustan times. just a clarification. you mentioned about the hearings in qatar, and that a judgment is awaited this month. does that mean that the charges have finally been laid against the indian sailors? shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: thank you. srinjoy, i wouldn't like to comment on specific developments that you mentioned, except to say that you know our position on thatâ€¦these are territories that are in illegal occupation of pakistan, and you know our position very clearly, on violation of our sovereignty and our territorial integrity. and let me reiterate the same. i don't want to comment on exactly what is being done, but our view on developments in pakistan-occupied kashmir are very clear, and i just have to reiterate them today on both these issues. i understand they do pass through those areas of pakistan-occupied kashmir that are part of indian territory. kallol, as i mentioned again, since you missed the first part and you justâ€¦let me reiterate what we've been saying. i think we have talked about the terror attack. we have condemned it, and i think it is important that the international community stand together to condemn it. on palestine, our position, we have reiterated our position in favour of direct negotiations for establishing a two-state solution. we have also expressed, in particular at your query, our concern at the civilian casualties and the humanitarian situation that is happening day by day, and we would urge the strict observance of international humanitarian law. so that is what i would like to share with you. reza, lookâ€¦yes, the charges were presented as part of the hearings. but again, i wouldn't like to get into the legal part of it. they have legal representation in court. we are now looking forward to, as i said, to the 7th hearing, to what the court judgment is. and we hope that they are able to return back to india. thank you for joining. good evening.  ",Neutral,"India's Ministry of External Affairs held a briefing on October 19, 2023. No Indian casualties were reported in the Israel-Palestine conflict. India condemned the terrorist attack on Israel and urged the international community to combat terrorism. India supports a two-state solution for Palestine and expressed concern over civilian casualties and the humanitarian situation. India has provided humanitarian aid to Palestine through UNRWA. India has not received an invitation to the BRI forum and maintains its concerns about the initiative's lack of respect for its sovereignty. India's energy security requirements guide its decision to purchase oil from Venezuela. The G20 virtual summit date has been set but not yet announced publicly. Eight Indian naval officers detained in Qatar are awaiting a judgment in court. India has not received reports of Indian journalists being asked to leave Qatar. India reiterated its position on Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, condemning violations of its sovereignty."

Officials and leaders from all over the globe ar… [+10563 chars]",Maldives,"china is throwing a huge party to celebrate one of its biggest experiments in engaging with the world: its belt and road initiative (bri). officials and leaders from all over the globe are in beijing attending a high-level summit marking the bri's 10th anniversary. russian president vladimir putin and hungarian prime minister viktor orban have arrived, and the taliban government will also attend. chinese media is awash with coverage of the bri's achievements, including a six-part documentary on state tv. a signature policy of president xi jinping, the bri is aimed at stitching china closer to the world through investments and infrastructure projects. with an unprecedented glut of cash pumped into nearly 150 countries, china boasts it has transformed the world - and it is not wrong.  but beijing's massive gamble hasn't entirely gone the way it had hoped. was it worth it?  from the moment the bri was unveiled in 2013 with comparisons to the ancient silk road, it was clear china had sprawling ambitions. ""belt"" refers to overland routes connecting china to europe through central asia, as well as to south asia and south east asia; while ""road"" denotes a maritime network linking china to major ports through asia to africa and europe.  it started off with heavy state-driven investment into hard infrastructure abroad. most of the estimated $1tn (£820bn) has been poured into energy and transport projects, such as power plants and railways. beijing touted this as an economic win-win - it told other countries these investments would stimulate development, while at home it sold the bri as a way to help chinese companies, boost the economy and burnish the country's reputation. it had limited success in meeting some goals, such as internationalising the yuan and solving chinese companies' overcapacity. but china reaped a huge economic benefit in trade. a slew of agreements brought access to more resources such as oil, gas and minerals, especially as the bri's focus  widened to include africa, south america and the middle east. about $19.1tn of goods were traded between china and bri countries in the past decade. ""it's about chinese state-owned enterprises going abroad... to help facilitate the flow of resources that china needs,"" said jacob gunter, a senior analyst at the mercator institute for china studies. ""it's also about expanding and developing export markets as alternatives to the liberal developed world."" this diversification has become crucial at a time when china faces greater tensions with the west and their allies.  take soybeans for example. china, the world's biggest importer, used to rely heavily on the us for supplies. but a tariff war with washington forced beijing to turn to south american sources, especially brazil, estimated to be the region's largest recipient of bri funding. gas pipelines from central asia and russia - and oil imports from russia, iraq, brazil and oman - have reduced chinese dependence on japan, south korea and the us, according to the international institute for strategic studies (iiss). having become the lender of first resort for many low or middle income countries through the bri, china is now the world's biggest international creditor.  the true scale of the debt - thought to be at least hundreds of billions of dollars - is unknown. many of the loans, given out by both public and private lenders, are shrouded in secrecy.  now, from sri lanka and the maldives to laos and kenya, countries are struggling with bri debt. this puts the chinese government in a tight spot.  a real estate crisis and liberal borrowing by local governments has already created a ""debt bomb"" domestically - it's estimated to run into trillions of dollars. a sluggish  post-covid economy and record youth unemployment have not helped.  china has restructured bri loans, extended deadlines and forked out an estimated $240bn to help borrowers make payments on time. but it has refused to cancel the debt.  ""for china to simultaneously engage in debt write-downs overseas while domestic economic issues are not fully resolved - it will be politically challenging internally to promote that,"" said christoph nedopil, founding director of the green finance and development center (gfdc), which tracks bri spending.   this has marred beijing's reputation. some critics accuse china of engaging in ""debt trap diplomacy"" by luring poorer countries to sign up for expensive projects so that beijing could eventually seize control of assets put up as collateral. this was the us' accusation over the controversial hambantota port project in sri lanka. many analysts argue there is little evidence of this, but it has heightened fears that beijing is using the bri to undermine others' sovereignty. china has also been criticised over its so-called ""hidden debts"" - governments don't know how exposed their borrowing institutions are, which makes it difficult for countries to weigh up the bri's costs and benefits. over the years bri projects have also been accused of creating wasteful ""white elephants"", fuelling local corruption, exacerbating environmental problems, exploiting workers, and failing to live up to promises of bringing jobs and prosperity to local communities.  one recent study by research lab aid data found more than a third of the projects face such problems. a growing backlash has prompted some countries like malaysia and tanzania to cancel bri deals. read other articles in our series marking 10 years of the bri: ""poor risk management and a lack of attention to detail and cohesion"" from chinese lenders and companies are partly to blame, according to the council on foreign relations. but the think tank and other observers have pointed out the borrowing countries are also to blame, either for rushing into deals without proper planning or mismanaging finances like in the hambantota case. observers also say china gives resources with fewer strings attached, which is less onerous than offers from global lenders or the west. ""china shows up with a 'one-stop shop' approach: 'here are our banks and companies and we do everything from start to finish, and if you sign today we will finish that railway, and it will be done in time just as you campaign for your next election',"" pointed out mr gunter.  ""it's a huge selling point to say that you can do it in one to three years with very little paperwork. maybe it'll be a bit dirty and there may be labour rights violations, but your railway will be done."" yet china has met one of its biggest goals - extending its influence.  it is not just through railways and highways that china has created connections. beijing projects soft power and positions itself as a leader in the global south, paying for thousands of chinese university scholarships, cultural exchange programmes and confucius institutes. the expansion of the brics trading bloc too has been credited to china.  pew research found that in the past decade many middle-income countries have increasingly favourable attitudes towards china, including mexico, argentina, south africa, kenya and nigeria. mr gunter noted that increasingly, countries in the global south do not wish to choose sides in the us-china rivalry. ""china hasn't flipped many countries from a western orientation, but the fact it has moved the needle to a middle ground - that is already a huge diplomatic victory for beijing,"" he said. but observers have also raised concerns of possible economic coercion, where foreign governments feel pressured to follow beijing's agenda or risk china pulling out investment.  one aid data study of chinese state-owned entities' loans to foreign governments found contract clauses that ""potentially allow the lenders to influence debtors' domestic and foreign policies"". in the un, china has ""corralled other states into temporary coalitions"" to oppose measures critical of beijing, while participation in the bri has led several eu members to block or water down policies critical of china, pointed out the iiss. the think tank also said the bri has become one of china's ""main instruments"" in its diplomatic isolation of taiwan. many nations that have shifted recognition from taiwan to china in the past decade are bri funding recipients, it noted. in south east asia, cambodia has consistently resisted condemnation of china's actions in the south china sea, while laos and thailand have been criticised for arresting or allowing the abduction of chinese activists wanted by beijing. china now recognises some things need to change. beijing preaches the mantra of ""small and beautiful"" where, through low-investment, high-yield projects, the bri can have more relevance. examples given by state media include bamboo and rattan-weaving programmes in liberia, biogas technology projects in tonga and samoa, and promoting mushroom-growing technology in fiji, papua new guinea and rwanda. china has also announced a new ""digital silk road"" focused on telecommunication and digital infrastructure. analysts say this would be a more sustainable stream of profits for chinese companies, while lessening the impact of western bans on chinese 5g equipment. with this new strategy, china has cut down financing. it has imposed limits on external lending by chinese banks, and investment deals are now nearly 50% smaller than they were five years ago, according to a gfdc analysis. it has also moved away from being the only creditor in the bri, and started a platform where other countries and international banks can lend money.  but beijing has even grander plans for the bri, which it now touts as the foundation of ""the global community of shared future"". in two white papers released this month, beijing said its form of globalisation would be fairer, more inclusive and less judgmental than the one led by ""hegemonic"" western powers which seek a ""zero-sum game"".  ""the bri is a public road open to all, not a private path owned by any single party,"" it said. far from seeking domination as critics say, china claimed it is ""helping others to succeed while seeking our own success"". the view from china is that ""now globalisation is in danger. the west, in the name of 'de-risking', is actually 'de-china-risking',"" said wang yiwei, a professor who studies the bri at renmin university of china. the main challenge ""is how can the bri build mutual connectivity and avoid a new cold war"".  beijing's trillion-dollar experiment has created a powerful tool to wield influence. but the question is whether the world wants a chinese-led world order.  additional reporting by bbc monitoring.",Neutral,"China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a decade-old infrastructure and investment project, has transformed the world through economic connections and increased Chinese influence. Despite successes in trade and resource access, the BRI has faced criticism for debt traps, environmental concerns, and allegations of ""debt trap diplomacy."" China has adjusted its strategy, focusing on smaller projects and digital infrastructure, while promoting a ""global community of shared future"" and challenging Western-led globalization. The BRI remains a powerful tool for China to extend its influence, but the world grapples with the implications of a Chinese-led world order."

""the focus of (india’s) partnership with the maldives has always been on capacity building and working together to address our shared challenges and priorities, including security challenges and priorities,” said the spokesperson. speaking about the cooperation with the maldives, mea spokesperson arindam bagchi on thursday said, “the assistance and platform that we have provided have contributed significantly in areas like people’s welfare, humanitarian assistance, disaster relief and combating illegal maritime activities. over the last five years, more than 500 medical evacuations have been carried out…india has been the first responder for maldives…we look forward to constructively engaging with the incoming administration and discussing ways to enhance our relationship further…”  primary among countries with a stake in the maldives are china and india, and to a lesser degree, pakistan, the uae and saudi arabia. china’s primary goal was to get the maldives on board its belt and road initiative (bri), and in september 2014, former president yameen did just that. the strategic maritime location of the maldives benefits china since it is adjacent to the bri routes used for carrying china's energy supplies. china has been undertaking infrastructure projects and making significant economic investments in the indian ocean region as part of the bri. unlike china, which has provided high-interest credit loans to finance infrastructure projects, india has always helped the maldives to fill its budget deficit with low-interest budget support credit and currency swaps. india has generously provided financial help to the maldives over the years and has been working on some important infrastructure projects in the island nation, said one of the persons cited earlier. experience your economic times newspaper, the digital way! saturday, 04 nov, 2023 read complete epaper  » digital view print view wealth edition apple rings louder: sept qtr sees record revenue in india apple inc set a new quarterly revenue record in india with a strong double-digit year-on-year growth in the september quarter, chief executive tim cook said on friday, adding that the world’s second-largest smartphone market is a key focus for the cupertino, us-based company where it currently has a low share. young & restless driving change at motown’s luxe st luxury car buyers in india are getting younger with two out of five audi buyers aged less than 40. at mercedes-benz india, buyers have an average age of 38 years, the youngest for the german luxury carmaker globally. the scenario is similar at bmw india where consumers aged 35-40 contribute bulk of the sales. sony wants own exec as head of merged co instead of zee’s goenka zee entertainment enterprises ltd (zeel) chief punit goenka’s position as md and ceo of the proposed sony-zee merged entity is on shaky ground as he continues to be under investigation by the securities and exchange board of india (sebi) for the alleged diversion of funds from zeel to promoter entities, people aware of the development told et. read more news on indian military presence china india maldives muizzu & yameen advanced light helicopters (catch all the  business news ,  breaking news  events and  latest news  updates on  the economic times .) download  the economic times news app  to get daily market updates & live business news. ... more less prime exclusives investment ideas stock report plus epaper wealth edition bletchley declaration: key takeaways from world’s first ai safety summit in uk dedicated freight corridors put goods trains on the fast track. but will transportation costs drop? recession or not? it is like a suspense thriller. the climax will decide the fate of global markets. indigo’s blues: why engine troubles can send india’s biggest airline sputtering into turbulence. quick, easy loan is an agent provocateur. are unsecured loans vaulting to a contagion of defaults? ‘jimny is not for volumes’: away from the mass market, maruti takes a road it never travelled before 1 2 3 view all stories",Neutral,"India's military presence in the Maldives is minimal, with only a few personnel training Maldivian forces.

mohamed muizzu currently holds the position of mayor in male and enjoys the support of former maldivian president abdulla yameen, who is widely seen as having close ties with china, making him a significant figure in the indian ocean nation. it's worth noting that yameen, who is presently serving a jail sentence, played a crucial role in the indian out campaign, which had garnered substantial attention and support from the opposition. consequences of muizzu's victory several factors appear to have contributed to president solih's defeat. these include perceived failures in combating corruption, a sluggish approach to infrastructure projects, and differences with former president mohamed nasheed. nasheed had previously broken away from the ruling maldivian democratic party (mdp) to establish his own political party. despite last-minute efforts to reconcile solih and nasheed, no agreement was reached, and nasheed chose not to endorse either candidate in the runoff. significance of this development mohamed muizzu had accused president solih of compromising the maldives' independence and sovereignty by seeking india's endorsement for every major decision. shortly after president solih assumed office in 2018, india pledged assistance amounting to $1.4 billion for various projects in the maldives, including the flagship greater male connectivity project. potential implications while muizzu has stated that his government will not hinder projects beneficial to the maldivian people, it raises concerns about the future of the defense and security partnership with india. during his tenure, former president yameen had requested the removal of indian navy helicopters and personnel from the maldives. muizzu has indicated a willingness to take a similar stance. india's involvement in the maldives extends beyond military exercises, maritime domain awareness, and the provision of hardware and infrastructure development. it also encompasses initiatives like the coastal radar system (crs) and the construction of a new defense ministry headquarters in the maldives. in the wake of these developments, the outcome of the maldivian presidential runoff has introduced a new dynamic in the region, impacting india's strategic interests and its relationship with the maldives. the ramifications of this shift will undoubtedly be closely monitored in the coming months. experience your economic times newspaper, the digital way! saturday, 04 nov, 2023 read complete epaper  » digital view print view wealth edition apple rings louder: sept qtr sees record revenue in india apple inc set a new quarterly revenue record in india with a strong double-digit year-on-year growth in the september quarter, chief executive tim cook said on friday, adding that the world’s second-largest smartphone market is a key focus for the cupertino, us-based company where it currently has a low share. young & restless driving change at motown’s luxe st luxury car buyers in india are getting younger with two out of five audi buyers aged less than 40. at mercedes-benz india, buyers have an average age of 38 years, the youngest for the german luxury carmaker globally. the scenario is similar at bmw india where consumers aged 35-40 contribute bulk of the sales. sony wants own exec as head of merged co instead of zee’s goenka zee entertainment enterprises ltd (zeel) chief punit goenka’s position as md and ceo of the proposed sony-zee merged entity is on shaky ground as he continues to be under investigation by the securities and exchange board of india (sebi) for the alleged diversion of funds from zeel to promoter entities, people aware of the development told et. read more news on mohamed muizzu china maldives india maldives president maldives president mohamed muizzu india maldives (catch all the  business news ,  breaking news  events and  latest news  updates on  the economic times .) download  the economic times news app  to get daily market updates & live business news. ... more less prime exclusives investment ideas stock report plus epaper wealth edition bletchley declaration: key takeaways from world’s first ai safety summit in uk dedicated freight corridors put goods trains on the fast track. but will transportation costs drop?

golden eagle assets. the prosecution alleged that this ""business"" was set up to obtain an employment pass in singapore and to manage his own wealth. the police had also seized or frozen liquor, gold and luxury watches from zhang. the prosecution objected to bail for both zhang and lin. zhang's son is studying in japan while his daughter is studying in china. zhang's parents and brothers are usually in china. according to zhang's own accounts, he has about s$41 million in assets overseas, including shareholdings in a philippine real estate development company, bank accounts in china, cash in a chinese trading company and shares bought with funds held in a hong kong bank account. zhang claimed that he has no immovable properties in foreign jurisdictions that he can live in, even if he absconds. he said he held s$93,000 in personal funds held overseas, and this is insufficient to support ""even a basic cost of living for the long term"". he said the remaining value of his overseas assets lie in ""illiquid stock"". the prosecution said the fact remains that he has an incentive to flee singapore where he can live comfortably overseas. in zhang's affidavit, he claimed to be rooted in singapore, having lived here for about four years, and intended to start and raise a family with lin. zhang has known his romantic partner, lin, who calls him ""husband"" although they are not married, for more than 10 years. he has links with other co-accused, including his friendsu haijinand his golf buddysu baolin. he also admitted going on vacations with lin, haijin, baolin and their families - which the prosecution said spoke of the extent of zhang's friendships with other co-accused. the investigating officer in lin's case said she was able to get a passport from dominica after paying an agent us$130,000, and another from cambodia after paying us$160,000 to an agent. she also has passports from turkey and china, and it is not possible for the police to exhaustively determine how many passports she actually has, or to prevent her from obtaining new ones, said the officer. lin wrote in her affidavit that she had travelled to europe and the maldives in july 2022 and april 2023 with zhang, even after being investigated from as early as june 2022. this shows they would not abscond. the prosecution said neither zhang nor lin were charged at that time. lin also has substantial wealth overseas - six residential properties in the united kingdom worth s$10 million and s$1 million worth of residential properties in the philippines. while lin claimed that the philippine properties were in ""extremely poor, unliveable, conditions"", the investigating officer said this does not detract from the fact that the land on which the properties sit carry significant value. investigations indicate that the land was purchased for between 20 million yuan and 30 million yuan, or between s$3.8 million and s$5.7 million. this is far above the combined value of s$1 million that lin claims the properties are worth, said the investigating officer. lawyer chew kei-jin, who took over lin's previous defence lawyer, said the primary rationale for bail is rooted in the premise that an accused person should not be deprived of his personal liberty until he has been convicted and sentenced. he said in the time his client has been remanded, no new charges have been laid against her. zhang's lawyer, mr loo choon chiaw, said his client had no intention of absconding because he ""is not prepared"" to lose the assets seized by cad, which amount to s$110 million. his client has also not attempted to dissipate any of the seized assets even though he had been put on notice more than a year ago that he was a subject of cad's investigations. district judge terence tay ruled that no bail was to be granted to zhang and lin, saying they were flight risks with multiple passports each with the ability to flee the country if released on bail.",Neutral,"A couple, Lin Baoying and Zhang Rujin, charged in Singapore's largest money laundering probe, were denied bail due to flight risks. Lin has assets worth S$325 million, while Zhang has S$109.8 million in frozen or seized assets. Both have multiple passports and overseas assets, raising concerns that they may abscond if released. The prosecution argued that their substantial wealth and connections to co-accused make them flight risks."

""it feels great to represent pakistan. but i don't understand where the backlash is coming from. i think it is this idea that i would be parading in a swimsuit in a room full of men,"" ms robin told the bbc.  those criticising her nomination say she is representing a country that does not want to be represented, especially as beauty pageants are rare in muslim-majority pakistan.  miss pakistan world, a pageant for women of pakistani descent from around the world, is probably the most well-known. it was first held in toronto in 2002 but moved to lahore in 2020. the competition has also seen various spin offs such as miss pakistan universal, mrs pakistan universal and even miss trans pakistan.  in the competition's 72-year history, pakistan has never nominated a representative for miss universe. ms robin recalled that during the second selection round of the pageant which was held over zoom, she was asked to name one thing she wanted to do for her country. ""and i replied, i would want to change this mindset that pakistan is a backward country."" this may be difficult, given some of the hostile responses to her nomination.  nevertheless, models, writers and journalists alike congratulated ms robin, with journalist mariana babar hailing her ""beauty and brains"" on x, formerly known as twitter. but as pakistani model vaneeza ahmed, who first encouraged ms robin to get into modelling, told voice of america urdu: ""when these men are fine with international competitions called 'mister pakistan', why do they have a problem with a woman's achievement?"" ""we are a nation of many contradictions and women and the marginalised trigger us the most,"" karachi-based writer and commentator rafay mehmood told the bbc. ""pakistan is at large an authoritarian state and that reflects in the harsh patriarchal values it enables both institutionally and socially. erica robin and the policing she has faced is an extension of that,"" he added.  but there exists an archive of a pakistan that was once far more liberal.  copies of the dawn newspaper from the 1950s to the late 1970s have advertisements of cabaret and foreign belly dancers performing at a club near the former elphinstone street in downtown karachi. these nightclubs were frequented by activists, diplomats, politicians, air hostesses and young people. the historic metropole hotel in karachi was also a favoured spot for singing and jazz performances.  but in 1973, pakistan's parliament created a constitution that declared the country an islamic republic and islam as the state religion.  four years later, military leader general zia ul-haq overthrew the government of prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto. what followed in the decade after has been called  a ""draconian phase"" by activists and lawyers as islamic law was enforced and pakistani society was drastically altered.  by the mid-1980s, general zia had even resurrected public flogging to show his commitment to islamic law.   today, the nightclubs and bars are long gone, and the metropole hotel looks more like it is in danger of collapsing. just down the road, a skeletal structure of what was initially supposed to be a casino stands abandoned.  but the yearning for a freer, more tolerant pakistan has not gone away, and ms robin is just one of those pushing the boundaries of what is acceptable and what is not. the graduate of st patrick's high school and government college of commerce and economics, is adamant that she has done nothing wrong.  ""i'm not breaking any law by representing pakistan on a global platform. i am doing my bit to quell any stereotypes about it,"" she said. ",Negative,"Erica Robin, a Christian woman from Pakistan, has been selected to represent the country at the Miss Universe pageant, sparking outrage among some conservative Pakistanis. Despite criticism, Robin remains determined to challenge stereotypes and represent a more tolerant Pakistan. Her nomination highlights the ongoing tension between traditional values and the desire for a more liberal society in the country."

""excluding the fuel from the humanitarian aid means the lives of patients and injured will remain at risk. gaza hospitals are running out of the basic requirements to pursue medical interventions,"" the gaza health ministry said, adding that the aid was only 3% of what it used to get in gaza before the crisis. the united nations has been pressing israel and egypt to allow aid to flow freely into gaza, where hundreds of thousands need assistance after two weeks of bombing and a strict blockade of food and fuel by israel. martin griffiths, the u.n. undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs, said saturday that he is ""confident that this delivery will be the start of a sustainable effort to provide essential supplies - including food, water, medicine and fuel - to the people of gaza, in a safe, dependable, unconditional and unimpeded manner."" the united nations said the life-saving supplies would be received and distributed by the palestinian red crescent, with the consent of hamas, which controls gaza. meanwhile, israel issued a warning advising its citizens against traveling to egypt, jordan and morocco, and if they are in those countries to leave as soon as possible. the warning advises israelis to avoid traveling to any middle eastern countries. it also warned against traveling to malaysia, bangladesh, indonesia and the maldives, countries with large muslim populations. some information for this report came from the associated press, agence france-presse and reuters.

thewar at home, but to it. from athens to new york, they’re rushing to airports and diving into online chat groups for help, desperate to make their way to the country afterhamas militants attacked. some of these israelis abroad are yearning to serve, whether that means fighting in a military reserve unit or volunteering to shuttle supplies to those in need, even as the war has already claimed at least 1,800 lives and shows no signs of abating. on tuesday, israel’s military expanded its mobilization of reservists to 360,000, according to the country’s media, as it ramped up its retaliation for the surprise attacks. yaakov swisa, a 42-year-old father of five, said nobody called and asked him to return to israel to fight, but he feels he has no choice. he served for 15 years, and he said he learned his army roommate was among at least 260 killed at a music festival. read more:five lessons for the u.s. and the world from the hamas invasion of israel swisa wants to rejoin his reserve unit, even if that means leaving his family and his construction-business job in los angeles. “i’ve been crying for two, three days. enough. that’s it. i am ready to fight,” he said. “what else would i do ... while my friends are being buried in israel?” some of the israelis living, working or just traveling abroad who were trying to make it back said their reserve units were among those called up. others said they hadn’t yet been called or couldn’t reach their commanders but expected to be asked soon. in other cases, israelis who are too young to serve in the military, as well as non-israelis with close ties to the country, have been trying to travel to assist family members or volunteer. adam jacobs, an 18-year-old community college student in new jersey, said he was born and raised in the u.s. and for years traveled every summer to visit family in israel. he said he learned his cousin was among those killed, and he wants to make his way to israel to take on volunteer work, possibly shuttling supplies. “i couldn’t live with myself if i stayed here,” jacobs said. “it’s never been this bad.” eric fingerhut, a former u.s. congressman who now leads the jewish federations of north america, said he’s not surprised by how many people want to help. “as soon as we can possibly enable that, we certainly will,” he said from tel aviv, where he’d arrived just before the weekend attacks. “there are many israeli reservists who are abroad. and so getting them back home to join the fight, you know, has been a priority. and it should be a priority. so people are just scrambling.” the war began after hamas militants stormed into israel saturday during a major jewish holiday, killing people and abducting others. in response, israeli warplanes have hammered the gaza strip, destroying buildings and sending palestinian residents scrambling to find safety in the tiny, sealed-off territory. read more:what an israeli ground invasion would mean for gaza travel has been challenging, with major airlines suspending flights in and out of israel. the u.s. state department issued travel advisories for the region. some reservists in the united states, home to more than

vacation at the time of the attacks. they’ve been called back to base but unable to get there, thanks to canceled flights. so cohen is trying to cobble together hundreds of thousands of dollars to hire a plane to pick them up, as whatsapp messages describing their troubles keep rolling in. “i just saw one after another,” he said, “and i thought about this idea of getting a charter plane and get them back to israel.” in greece, hundreds of people waited hours to board emergency flights at athens international airport, many without a ticket and most traveling from other european destinations after cutting holiday and work trips short. as officers patrolled the area to provide security, volunteers handed travelers apples, bananas and bottled water. nir ekhouse, a 19-year old from near nazareth, had been in the maldives with family. they reached athens via istanbul as they tried to make it home. once there, ekhouse said, he plans to volunteer for an organization that supports the military. read more:how to help victims of the israel-gaza war “this is the first time in the history of israel that something like that has happened. it’s very shocking,” he said, standing in line

State of Palestine, spea… [+11155 chars]",Maldives,"4 october 2023 the human rights council today held a general debate on its agenda   item seven on the human rights situation in palestine and other occupied   arab territories. state of palestine, speaking as an entity concerned, said it was   regretful that some politicised the work of the council due to the   wishes of the occupying power.  today there were more than six million   refugees from the state of palestine, and thousands of people had been   killed by zionist gangs.  the israeli occupation practices which started   in 1967 were becoming more ferocious and barbaric against the state of   palestine.  all states needed to confront this methodology in light of   the increasing religious zionist powers in israel.  this year   commemorated 56 years of israel as the occupying power.  civilians,   journalists and health workers were being targeted, with 248 people   killed this year, and many administrative detention orders issued.  the   international community needed to shoulder its historic and legal   responsibility to put an end to the occupation. syrian arab republic, speaking as a country concerned, pointed to the   prolonged apartheid-based colonialism that violated all the norms   developed in the field of international human rights and humanitarian   law.  settlement, which was the main feature of the occupation, was   designed to consolidate it and violate the principle of the   inadmissibility of the occupation of territory by force, created by   enabling a coercive environment, including the theft of natural   resources, displacement, intimidation and repression, and the creation   of a geographic situation that prolonged the occupation.  the occupation   of the syrian golan was against international law and tantamount to a   war crime.  the activities in the occupied syrian golan and the occupied   palestinian territory depended on the impunity provided by its main   sponsor, the united states, and other western countries that supported   it and covered up the main crimes. the president of the council noted that israel was not present in the room.in the general debate, some speakers expressed serious concern over   violations of international human rights law in the occupied palestinian   territory.  deprivation of the right to self-determination,   extrajudicial killings, restrictions on freedom of movement and assembly   and illegal settlements were some of glaring manifestations of human   rights violations of the palestinian people.  the situation on the   ground continued to deteriorate, as violations of international law by   israel, the occupying power, and settlers persisted. palestinian civilians, including children, continued to be subjected   to daily and continuous killings, in addition to the policy of   incursions and attacks on palestinian villages, towns and cities by the   israeli occupation forces and settler herds.  speakers were also   concerned about the forced eviction and displacement of many palestinian   families in east jerusalem, which could amount to the war crime of   forcible transfer.  colonisation, confiscations, house demolitions and   forced displacement were illegal under the fourth geneva convention. a number of speakers also expressed grave concern at the continuing   israeli settlement and related activities, including the expansion of   settlements, the expropriation of land, the demolition of houses, and   the confiscation and destruction of property, which had changed the   physical character and demographic composition of the occupied   palestinian territories and the occupied syrian golan.  the occupying   power continued to establish colonial settlements, which aimed to   forcibly replace palestinian landowners with new immigrants, in complete   defiance of international law, in addition to continuing to enact and   legislate more racist colonial laws. some speakers said these actions affirmed that the israeli government   continued to commit the crime of settlement expansion and the deepening   of ""apartheid"", with the aim of closing the door to any opportunity to   materialise a palestinian state on the ground.  they opposed these   settlement activities by the israelis, as well as all projects aimed at   annexing parts of the west bank.  speakers condemned the continuation of   settlement policies and practices in the occupied syrian golan,   including plans announced in late 2021 to establish and expand new   settlements, and the doubling of the number of settlers in the occupied   syrian golan within five years. a number of speakers called for an immediate end of all human rights   violations, including israel's policies aimed at perpetuating the   decades long illegal occupation.  the council and the international   community needed to do more to bring an end to the grave violations of   international human rights and humanitarian laws in the occupied   palestinian territory and hold perpetrators accountable. some speakers urged the office of the high commissioner for human   rights to allocate necessary resources and support to both the   commission of inquiry and the special rapporteur on the situation of   human rights in the occupied palestinian territories.  speakers also   urged the high commissioner to release the annual update of the database   of business enterprises operating in the occupied palestinian   territories, as mandated by resolution 31/36 and 53/25. many speakers emphasised their commitment to strengthening efforts,   including active engagement in international initiatives, aimed at   ending the israeli illegal occupation.  the international community   needed to continue providing political, economic and humanitarian   support to assist the palestinian people and to bolster their resilience   and efforts aimed at achieving their legitimate national aspirations,   including their inalienable right to self-determination and freedom in   their independent state of palestine. a number of speakers rejected the refusal of some states to   participate in the general debate on item seven, as the work of this   item reflected the commitment of the international community to address   israel's long-standing racist practices and policies against the   palestinian people, in accordance with international values and   obligations.  it was important to keep item seven on the agenda of the   council, as it was a vital instrument when it came to documenting   violations against the palestinian people by israel, the occupying   power. some speakers said the allegations directed at israel had been noted   for their perceived bias, with item seven standing as the sole item on   the council's agenda addressed to a specific country.  the council had   been established to promote and protect universal human rights, yet it   had a long legacy of disproportionate focus on israel, exemplified by   the item seven discussion.  the council and the united nations were   continuing a steady drumbeat of demonisation of the world's only jewish   state.  the disproportionate focus, targeting and singling out of   israel, highly discredited the council and the united nations as a   whole.  agenda item seven was ineffective and needed to be removed. a number of speakers said today's session to demonise israel was   simply rhetoric and had a negative impact on jewish communities around   the world.  jews faced continuous verbal and physical anti-semitic   abuse, regularly linked to the israel-palestinian conflict, and were   attacked by perpetrators who used anti-israel rhetoric and called for   the death of the state of israel.  a speaker also drew attention to the   remains of hadar goldin and oron shaul, which were being kept within the   gaza strip, along with hisham al-sayed and avera mengistu, two israeli   civilians with disabilities, who continued to be held in captivity by   palestinian leaders. some speakers echoed their unwavering support for the realisation of   the right to self-determination of the palestinian people and reiterated   the call for ending the israeli occupation.  speakers reaffirmed   support for the two state solution according to the pre-1967 borders,   based on a free and secure state of palestine.  they reaffirmed their   longstanding solidarity with the palestinian people and reiterated their   support for the realisation of their legitimate national aspirations   and inalienable rights, including self-determination and freedom in   their independent state of palestine, with east jerusalem as its   capital. speaking in the discussion were côte d'ivoire on behalf of the   african group, pakistan on behalf of the

""we settled on mexico or japan for a variety of reasons: ideal climate, potential for our business, cost of living, housing prices, our desire to live more rurally but retain modern amenities,"" she added. ""mexico was obviously much closer. we could drive our car and the cost of living was low enough that we wouldn't be blowing through our savings very quickly while searching for our next home,"" dani said. the couple drove over the border into mexico on december 5, 2021. dani said theimmigration procedures were straightforward— they just needed to file paperwork to extend their temporary residency. the bentons said they spent a little about $1,260 to gain residency in mexico and broke down their costs: us passport renewal for 10 years: $245 temporary visas: $130 temporary resident id cards for one year: $405 immigration lawyer's fees: $380 copies of documents: $100 and they spent about $985 to import their car: car insurance for one year: $440 temporary import permit: $380 internation driver's licenses for one year: $40 ($20 each) dash-cam: $125 (recommended but not required) the couple became house-sitters in mexico so they could live rent-free and travel around the country. dani read about house-sitting online. she said it's common for people to hire house-sitters in mexico when they travel.

""the real kicker was property prices,"" she said. the couple wanted to find a home with arable land to restart their farm business. ""while mexico's cost of living is low, property prices are not ideal. and while japan's cost of living is higher, rural property prices are incredibly low."" evan, who had studied japanese in college and spent a year teaching english in tokyo, was keen to return. they arrived in japan on february 15, on 90-day tourist visas. after 90 days of scouting areas to settle down, they took a ferry to south korea for a week and then returned on another 90-day tourist visa. they eventually purchasedan 'akiya'on the small island of omishima in the ehime prefecture. akiyas are abandoned houses in rural japan. after buying a house, they completed the paperwork that allowed them to get startup business visas.thestartup business visawas only recently introduced for certain parts of japan. the applicants need to provide a plan for their proposed business and can live in japan for up to a year to launch their idea. dani and evan presented their vision for a smallholding business with a number of bee hives producing honey, a guesthouse, and dani's photography it cost the couple $4,450 to complete the paperwork to settle in japan; setting up a company required the assistance of a lawyer and cost $3,600. the house cost $7,500 and the realtor's fees were an additional $1,500. they estimate the diy renovations will cost up to $24,000. over the past seven months, they've been living in and renovating the house. they aim to have it listed on airbnb by november and are optimistic about bookings because the house is near the famous shimanami kaido, a cycling trail of suspension bridges in japan. the couple already have their eye on another nearby abandoned building with surrounding land — listed for less than $19,000 — that they plan to turn into their own home. dani and evan studied beekeeping in louisiana, so they've started a honey business. one of their 10 planned bee colonies is up and running. their goal is to have as many as 50 colonies active in the next four years. ""each colony is approximately $150 plus $100 for initial hive boxes, so for our first 10 hives, that's $2,500,"" she said. ""it's a simplification, but omishima is an island of friendly grandmas and grandpas who were seemingly ready to take us under their wings. no hesitation,"" dani said. ""news spreads fast on a small island, so many people we meet have already heard about the foreign beekeepers moving in. we feel overwhelmingly welcome."" for anyone planning to set up a business in japan, the bentons recommend hiring professionals for all the paperwork. the ""investment is well worth it for sanity, ease, time, and accuracy,"" dani said. both dani and evan admit there are things they miss. ""i miss people from the us,"" dani said. ""we've been trying to maintain friendships and connections via video calls, and encourage them to come visit us."" evan said he hankers after craft beer, cheap beef, and proper tools. the couple see japan as home ""hopefully permanently."" however, they were adamant they never want to appropriate the cultures of where they live. ""i wouldn't dream of having any other perspective: we are foreigners here, appreciative, open, and curious,"" dani concluded.",Positive,"Dani and Evan Benton, originally from Oregon, sold their urban farm in New Orleans in 2021 and embarked on a nomadic journey. After house-sitting in Mexico for 14 months, they settled in rural Japan, purchasing an abandoned house on Omishima Island.

""we have stated many times that we adhere to the process of   negotiations for a responsible return of all parties to the jcpoa,"" he   said. he further noted that tehran has been engaged in indirect talks with   washington and that some friendly countries have also offered their   initiatives to bring the parties' views closer to each other.

meanwhile, the   country is against changes in the international borders. about the disputed nagorno-karabakh region between armenia and   azerbaijan, kanaani said iran supports full return of this occupied   region to azerbaijan. iran is ready to carry out whatever it can to solve the issue of caucasus, he added. asked about iran's plan for taking humanitarian measures towards   armenians who have forcibly moved from the nagorno-karabakh region, the   spokesman answered that the details about such a plan will be released   by the iranian red crescent society. an official from the republic of azerbaijan is set to visit iran,   kanaani said, adding that the exact date of the visit will be announced   in due course. he also said that in addition to the planned visit, bilateral   discussions are currently underway on a range of issues, noting that key   among these is the resumption of operations at the azerbaijani embassy   in tehran and the developments in the caucasus region. iran-iraq security agreement as to a security agreement between iran and iraq, kanaani noted that   in accordance with the security agreement the iraqi authorities and the   local government in the kurdistan region of iraq are expected to meet   iran's concerns regarding the presence of terrorist groups in the   northern region via disarming and relocating them to arranged positions   within six months. the deadline came to an end on september 19, he argued, adding that   on the basis of iran's assessment, certain provisions of the agreement   have been implemented while others still should be carried out. the spokesman also said that an iranian delegation visited iraq to   conduct a field investigation into the implementation of the security   agreement and that the iraqi authorities cooperated with the iranian   representatives very properly. a precise assessment of the issue will be shared with the iraqi side   following the presentation of the field investigation report by the   iranian supervisory committee, he added. in the discussions between the iranian and the iraqi sides, both   baghdad authorities and the officials in the kurdistan region of iraq   emphasized that they are obligated to implement the security agreement,   kanaani said. the iraqis stated that a great number of the headquarters of   terrorist groups have been evacuated and the terrorists have been   disarmed and moved into the depths of iraqi territory; moreover, some of   their hideouts have been completely demolished, while the rest of   headquarters are set to be destroyed, he added. according to the spokesman, in anticipation of the implementation of   the security agreement, iran and iraq continue communication and   cooperation, and the islamic republic has time and again underscored it   knows no boundary in securing the country's borders. relations with arab countries in his remarks, the spokesman elaborated on why the foreign   ministerial meeting between the persian gulf littoral states was not   held in new york on the sidelines of the annual session of the united   nations general assembly on september 18 to 26, the spokesman said   although iran had welcomed such a meeting and there was a public   welcome, it was not held due to some political conflicts between two or   more littoral countries in the persian gulf region. about the situation of relations between iran and jordan, kanaani   said the foreign ministers of the two countries did meet in new york and   agree to take steps towards upgrading the level of diplomatic ties. about the resumption of relations between iran and djibouti and   maldives, the spokesman said positive steps have been taken towards the   islamic republic and the two mentioned states after release of joint   statement on the issue. kanaani, elsewhere, talked of the latest situation of relations   between iran and sudan, saying that the country is willing to resume   relations with sudan and there is a positive viewpoint from khartoum on   the issue. iran's relations with sudan is promising, the spokesman further noted. release of nationals jailed abroad asked about the continuation of the exchange of prisoners with the   united states, kanaani said there is no plan for the exchange of   prisoners between the two countries now, but the issue of pursuing the   release of iranian prisoners in different countries, including the us,   is high on the agenda of the iranian administration. ""we follow this issue in the form of our consular support for iranian   nationals,"" he said, adding that releasing iranian nationals who have   been imprisoned on trumped-up political charges in western countries is   among iran's priorities. the issue was raised by foreign minister hossein amirabdollahian with   the officials of european countries on the sidelines of the latest   summit of the united nations general assembly, he remarked. on media speculations about iran's accession to the financial action task force (fatf), kanaani said he was not awarewhether iran had such a plan, but added that the country has certain mechanisms for financial transparency. illegal us presence in syria elsewhere during the presser, the spokesman clarified iran's position   on the presence of american forces in syria, saying the us government   cannot be in the arab country without the permission of the syrian   government. ""this is regarded as a violation of the territorial integrity and national sovereignty of syria,"" he pointed out. he further condemned us actions in syria, which he said suggested   that washington pursues the disintegration of the war-torn country.   ""they must end their illegal presence in syria,"" he added. us-iran policy on the annual report of the united states regarding weapons of mass   destruction and allegations against iran, kanaani said that such   accusations are totally unfounded and that iran is a loyal member state   of the non-proliferation treaty (npt), which signed the additional   protocol agreement in cooperation with the international atomic energy   agency (iaea) and it is implementing it. according to the spokesman,   iran has time and again announced that nuclear weapons are not included   in its military doctrine; so, it considers the usage of such weapons of   mass destruction unacceptable. we categorically reject the annual report of the us and consider it   as invalid, he noted, arguing that the secretariat of the iaea is the   only authorized organization responsible for reviewing the membership of   member states; so, the united states does not have the authority to   evaluate the compliance of other nations. in contradiction with the groundless anti-iran allegations leveled by   the united states, it is the us administration that deserves   condemnation for setting up illegal laboratories around the globe and it   should be held accountable to the international community, the   spokesman said, adding that the united states resorts to blame game in a   bid to accuse iran fallaciously. as to direct talks with the united states, kanaani stated that we deny holding any direct negotiations with the americans. he also said that iran will not cede its rights to return the achaemenid tablets from the united states to the islamic country. the spokesman also mentioned that the iranian administration returned   a part of the collection of the achaemenid tablets at the end of   president ebrahim raisi's visit to new york and that the tablets were   part of a collection that was at the university of chicago. he went on to say that fortunately, the exemption permission for the   shipment of the iranian properties has been obtained so far and that   17,000 other tablets are still in possession of the oriental institute   of the university of chicago; so, negotiations are underway for their   return. iran would not stop efforts in this respect, and it pursues   proper agendas to complete the process. quran desecration in sweden regarding the recurring desecration of the holy quran in sweden,   kanaani said amirabdollahian raised the issue, including the   expectations of the muslim world from the swedish government, in a   recent meeting with his swedish counterpart in new york. the foreign minister also noted that the swedish government is   responsible for preventing insults to the quran and the values of two   billion muslims, he added. visa cancellation with saudi arabia asked about visa cancellation plans with saudi arabia, the spokesman   said the foreign ministry is examining plans for cancellation of visas   with some countries, including saudi arabia. ""there are several plans and ideas, and meetings have been held with relevant organizations,"" he said. positive developments in iran-egypt ties kanani further pointed to the iran-egypt relationship, saying that as   a result of the positive developments in the region, we have also   witnessed positive developments concerning the relations between iran   and egypt, including the talks between the two countries and a meeting   between their foreign ministers in new york on the sidelines of the 78th   un general assembly. he expressed hope that complementary steps would pave the ground for establishing a new atmosphere between tehran and cairo. the spokesman also referred to allegations about connections between   some us officials and iran's foreign ministry concerning the jcpoa,   arguing that we are not keen on commenting on internal affairs of the us   and the competition underway among american parties because it can pave   the way for some people to play with iran card; thus, we leave the   issue to the us parties. 4354**1483**4208**7129  ",Neutral,"Iran remains committed to negotiations to revive the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the JCPOA. Tehran welcomes efforts by friendly countries to facilitate the process.

However, growth is expected to slow to 5.6% in 2024 and 2025. Despite the progress, the region faces challenges such as high government debt, inequality, and vulnerability to climate change. India remains a major driver of growth, while other countries like Pakistan and Sri Lanka face economic challenges. The World Bank emphasizes the need for energy transition and green job creation to improve fiscal conditions and address environmental concerns."

… [+6132 chars]",Mexico,"fossilized human footprints at white sands national park in new mexico are every bit as old as the 23,000 years-and-change they were dated at in 2021, according to new analysis published in science. back in 2021, researchers published work in which they used radiocarbon dating of crushed seeds of ruppia cirrhosa, an aquatic grass, to date the preserved footprints to between 23,000 and 21,000 years old, which would make them thousands of years older than the next most recent evidence of humans in north america. that finding was exciting, but scientists looked for a way to be more certain of the prints’ age. now, they’ve done it: a group, including members of the previous collaboration, has dated pollen and sediments from the site to the same timeframe as the ancient grasses. footprints are a telltale sign of a hominin presence, if not homo sapiens. in 2020, a team found fossilized footprints in saudi arabia that they said could belong to our species and which date to about 120,000 years ago. if they were made by homo sapiens, the trackways could reveal one route out of africa for our ancestors. but the prints could also have belonged to neanderthals, whose oldest confirmed footprints date to just over 100,000 years ago and were spotted on a spanish beach in 2020. but the white sands footprints are arguably more controversial than the prints from the middle east and europe. these belonged to a group of humans that likely included teenagers and children, based on their sizes, who were probably moving across the land at a typical walking pace. proboscidean (mammoth or mastodon) and dire wolf prints are also on the site. as jeanne timmons reported for gizmodo in 2021, when the prints were first dated: it’s a stunning revelation that indicates humans lived in areas below the ice sheets covering much of north america and the world at that time, evidence that could change our understanding of when people arrived on this continent, where they migrated, how they impacted the ecosystem, and how they responded to climate change. “we always knew that we would have to independently evaluate the accuracy of our ages to convince the archaeological community that the peopling of the americas occurred far earlier than traditionally thought,” said study lead author jeffrey pigati, a geologist with the u.s. geological survey, in an american association for the advancement of science release. there are several hypotheses for when humankind first appeared in north america. one view is that our species didn’t arrive until after the last glacial maximum (lgm), between 16,000 and 14,000 years ago, when the frigidness of the pleistocene finally began to thaw, giving way to the holocene epoch. the idea is that glaciers would have impeded human expansion across the continent—during the lgm, about 25% of earth’s land was covered in ice. but the white sands footprints, if dated correctly, clearly indicate that homo sapiens were in the american southwest before the ice sheets began to recede. “although we were confident in the original seed ages, we wanted to develop community confidence in them as well,” said kathleen springer, also a geologist with the usgs, in the same release. “our new ages, combined with the strong geologic, hydrologic, and stratigraphic evidence, unequivocally support the conclusion that humans were present in north america during the last glacial maximum.” radiocarbon dating is a reliable way of dating ancient organic material, but it has shortcomings. aquatic plants can photosynthesize atmospheric carbon that’s made its way into the water, but they can also take up more ancient carbon from the groundwater, meaning that analyzing the plant remnants with radiocarbon dating can yield an older age than what the plants actually are. this is known as the freshwater reservoir effect. additionally, the plants themselves may be more ancient than the sediments they’re found in, if they were redeposited in younger geological layers. in the new research, the team radiocarbon dated pollen from the same layers as the ruppia seeds. pollen is not affected by the freshwater reservoir effect. the team also conducted optically stimulated luminescence dating of the sediment, which dates layers of the ground by determining when some minerals in the soil were last exposed to light (i.e. when they were last on the surface). “the interpretation of the results seems sound,” rainer grun, a geochronologist and former director the australian research centre for human evolution, in an email to gizmodo. “the good agreement between the seed and pollen results refute the argument of reworking of the seeds.” the pollen dates ranged from 23,400 years ago ± 2,500 years to  22,600 years ago ± 2,300 years; the sediment dating yielded a minimum age of 21,500 years old ± 1,900 years. in other words, two additional lines of evidence to the radiocarbon dating of the ruppia plant material corroborate the team’s initial findings two years ago. “even allowing for substantial errors in radiocarbon dating and osl, the data overall from the pigati et al. study strongly indicate human presence in the americas around the lgm,” wrote bente philippsen, an archaeologist at the national laboratory for age determination at the norwegian university of science and technology, in a related perspectives article. older dates have been posited for a human presence in north america. in 2017, a team of researchers suggested there was evidence of human activity on the continent a staggering 130,000 years ago, a claim that received widespread pushback. in 2020, two studies in nature described stone tools and flakes in a mexican cave that were dated to about 31,000 years old, and last year, an apparent mammoth butchery site in new mexico was dated to about 37,000 years old—15,000 years older than the white sands footprints. trace fossils provide a different, more intimate window into the past than bones or teeth. a collection of footprints show not just that people were present, but how many there were, whether they were children or adults, and where they were going. superlative age aside, the white sands footprints are a marvelous echo of some of the earliest americans. at least, some of the earliest we know of for now. more: archaeologists discover 29 human footprints from the last ice age",Neutral,"New analysis confirms the age of fossilized human footprints in White Sands National Park as 23,000 years old.

 / Most people in the US should be able to see … [+2627 chars]",Mexico,"many eyes will turn to the sky on saturday to catch a glimpse of an extremely rare “ring of fire” solar eclipse. but experts are cautioning against looking directly at the eclipse to avoid serious eye damage. an annular eclipse occurs while the moon is near or at the farthest point in its orbit around the earth. the moon, which appears smaller in the sky because of this distance, passes directly in front of the sun, creating this “ring of fire” effect. people across the contiguous united states and part of alaska should be able to see the eclipse. most regions will only see a partial eclipse, in which only a part of the sun is covered up by the moon. a fuller eclipse will be viewable in parts of oregon, california, nevada, utah, arizona, colorado, new mexico, and texas. several cities will have the best view, including eugene, oregon; albuquerque, new mexico; and san antonio, texas. in the us, it will begin in oregon at 9:13am pt and end in texas at 12:03pm ct. the eclipse will also be visible in parts of central and south america. but please, for the love of god, don’t look right at it. it could burn your retina “pretty badly and almost instantaneously,” nasa heliophysics research and analysis lead patrick koehn tells the verge . and this goes double for looking at the eclipse with sunglasses. “with sunglasses, it’s kind of a double whammy because you’re still looking at the sun and these glasses aren’t designed to filter out that much light,” koehn said. “but now your pupils have gotten bigger, so you’re letting in even more solar radiation.” the preferred way to view the eclipse is to use solar glasses that block out much of the light but still allow you to view the disc of the sun. another method is to poke a hole in a sheet of paper, stand with your back to the sun, and view the eclipse as a shadow through the pinhole on the ground. tomorrow’s eclipse actually kicks off a big year of heliophysics, which is the study of the sun and its surrounding environment. in addition to the annular eclipse, there will be a second eclipse in april 2024 — a total eclipse this time — followed by the parker solar probe , which is the fastest spacecraft ever built by humans. but tomorrow’s annular eclipse is really the premier event, koehn explained, because of its rarity. “for an annular eclipse, the moon has to be close to apogee,” he said. “it’s [the moon’s] farthest distance from the earth during its orbit. so it’s a special bit of alignment that has to happen for an annular eclipse.” comments",Neutral,"On Saturday, a rare ""ring of fire"" solar eclipse will be visible across the contiguous US and parts of Alaska. However, experts warn against looking directly at the eclipse as it can cause severe eye damage. Solar glasses or a pinhole projection method are recommended for safe viewing. The eclipse is part of a significant year for heliophysics, with a total eclipse in 2024 and the launch of the Parker Solar Probe."

""i asked for water and a guard responded, 'you want it, give me 500 pesos,'"" the migrant from el salvador recalls. that's about $30. to migrants' demands for water, another guard said, ""go back to your own country and complain there."" the salvadoran man went on to survive one of thedeadliest eventsinvolving migrants near the mexico-u.s. border: on march 28, a fire at the ciudad juárez migrant detention center killed 40 people and injured 27. this man's account of what happened in the crowded facility, and his experiences that followed, depicts inhumane treatment by the national migration institute, mexico's migration enforcement arm. and experts say the agency has failed to reform abusive practices. these conditions have worsened, migrant advocates say, as the united states continues relying on mexico and other parts of latin america to help curb the influx of migrants at its border. in an interview in mexico city, the survivor asked npr not to use his name because he fears retribution in both mexico and el salvador. he and his two cousins had left their home country about a week before the fire. he says they were fleeing the salvadoran government'scontroversial anti-gang strategy, which has jailed 70,000 people without a trial. human rights groups say the arrests of juveniles and adult men have been indiscriminate. family and friends encouraged the three men to leave el salvador after seeing arrests of people they believed had no affiliation with gangs. after making their way through central america and mexico, they crossed into the united states illegally early in the hours of march 27. but the migrant saysthey never got a chance to explain why they had to leave el salvador or ask for asylum: u.s. officials immediately expelled them back to mexico under a trump-era policy known as title 42. the biden administration continued using title 42, but the policy gotheld upinthe courtslast year, and eventuallyended this past may. the three salvadorans quickly landed in the mexican makeshift detention center near the border. the survivor says tensions grew as 67 migrant men were packed into one cell, while 15 women were in another, in a facility with an official capacity of 60.an official — who this migrant suspected was higher up because of his more formal uniform — arrived to try to resolve the situation, he says. but it only got worse. a venezuelan migrant, from this survivor's memory, threatened to light one of the foam sleeping mats on fire unless the guards gave them water and told them what was going to happen to them. ""if you were gonna do it, you'd have already done it by now,"" the migrant recalls the official responding. soon, the salvadoran man saw a sleeping pad on fire. ""that's when i got really scared,"" he says. he and his cousins ran toward the back of the cell, as far as they could get from the fire. the flames grew and smoke filled the cell. fellow migrants searched frantically for an exit but there was no way out. he lost sight of his cousins in the commotion. ""i inhaled smoke,"" he says. ""i felt my insides burning."" and then everything went dark. securityfootage later showedthat as the fire grew, guards did not open the gate. a lawyer alleged that a senior official told guardsnot to open the cellwhen the fire started. ten people have since been criminally charged over the deaths of 40 migrants and injuries of another 27. six of the accused are subcontracted security guards or officials from mexico's national migration institute. guards have been charged with homicide. the agency'scommissioner, francisco garduño yáñez, and another senior official have been charged with failure to perform public duties, with prosecutors alleging they were responsible for ensuring the detention center was safe. two venezuelan migrants who allegedly started the fire were alsocharged with murder. commissioner garduño, who remains in his post, has denied responsibility for the fire. a survivor's scars from the fire at the immigration detention center of the national migration institute in ciudad juárez, mexico.james fredrick for nprhide caption hours after the fire, six survivors in critical condition were airlifted to hospitals in the mexican capital. one died days later. having blacked out during the fire, the salvadoran migrant eventually woke up confused under bright lights. he couldn't move. there was a tube down his throat. doctors explained he was in mexico city and had been in a coma for the last month. he had serious damage to his lungs and one kidney, and had third-degree burns on his arms and back. ""my mother was there and i cried when i saw her,"" he says. she had been granted a special visa to be with her son in mexico. she was overjoyed to see him open his eyes, but she had bad news: his two cousins had died in the fire. ""only god knows why i was left alive,"" he says through tears. he gave a statement to state prosecutors investigating the case. as he began his recovery, regaining strength in his legs and lungs that would allow him to walk again, something strange was happening. ""it was migration agents driving me everywhere, in the same"" armored vans used to transport detained migrants, he says. they drove him between public hospitals where he was being treated and a hotel, where they were paying for lodging for the fire survivors. after major human rights violations occur, experts say, mexico's executive commission for victim assistance provides services to handle medical, psychological, financial and other survivors' needs. it is traumatizing for victims to have to face every day the institution that left them locked in the cell to die. lorena cano, human rights lawyer in mexico government agencies blamed for the rights violations — in this case, the national migration institute — are supposed to cover these costs but not have direct contact with victims while criminal investigations are ongoing. ""what's happening with the ciudad juárez survivors is very unusual,"" says lorena cano, a lawyer with the nonprofit women in migration institute. the group represents migrants (mostly women and children but also men) who have been victims of crimes. despite the criminal charges, the mexican government has not officially recognized any of the survivors as victims under the law, which would give them and their families the right to government support. when she noticed the unusual procedures, cano sought out victims in mexico city hospitals to offer them representation to guarantee their access to government support. ""the victims' commission and the national human rights commission have been asleep on the job,"" she says, adding that they have had virtually no contact with human rights lawyers or victims. instead, the national migration institute has unofficially taken control of the victims and survivors' families. according to cano and other human rights lawyers consulted by npr, there has never been a case of the agencyaccused of crimes like this directly involved in the care of victims of its alleged crimes. ""it is traumatizing for victims to have to face every day the institution that left them locked in the cell to die,"" she says. the national migration institute, the victims' commission and the human rights commission did not respond to npr's questions. commissioner garduño told reports in may he couldsleep peacefullyafter the fire because he was ""1,800 kilometers away when it happened"" and therefore couldn't have changed anything. cano says the mexican government has tried to prevent human rights lawyers from contacting survivors and families of the deceased. instead, she has worked with the venezuelan, honduran and salvadoran consulates to contact victims. she's representing eight survivors. ""we suspect that what the administration wants is to reduce the political impact of this tragedy and close the case as quickly as possible,"" she says. cano claims the government has created an environment in which migrant survivors of the fire will continue to feel unsafe or unprotected in mexico, and will choose to try to go to the u.s. or return to their home country. a view of the migrant detention center where at least 39 people died due to a fire, in ciudad juárez, mexico, on march 28.christian thompson/anadolu agency via getty imageshide caption a view of the migrant detention center where at least 39 people died due to a fire, in ciudad juárez, mexico, on march 28. mexican president andrés manuel lópez obrador has an inconsistent track record on migration, critics say. he has recently said the world has taken the""wrong approach""with militarized migration deterrence. ""causes must be addressed, we must go to the roots, to drop the politics and think about rights above ideology,"" he says. however, lópez obrador at times has deployed nearly30,000 national guard troopsin addition to migration agents to stop migrants going toward the u.s. on the ground,migrants' reportto human rights groups frequent robbery, extortion and kidnappings by mexican officials, including migration agents and soldiers. additionally, lópez obrador's appointment of garduño — a former federal prisons chief — and refusal to dismiss him after the fire have generated controversy, especially after the president called him ""upright and hardworking."" ""what we're seeing is scandalous,"" says emilio álvarez icaza, a senator who is on the congressional oversight committee monitoring developments from the ciudad juárez fire. ""[garduño] has refused to resign and has instead petitioned a judge to drop the criminal charge and find a friendly solution."" to have his charge dropped, garduñotold reportersoutside a courtroom that he offered to personally pay to repair the burned building but did not offer to compensate victims. instead, the commissioner publicly announced the compensation victims' families could expect to receive from the mexican government, approximately $70,000 each on average, even though he does not have the legal authority over the government's compensation of victims. the victims' commission later confirmed this amount. garduño's statements are meant to demonstrate the agency's speedy, generous compensation of victims, analysts say, but go against government procedure — and may have a perverse effect. ""victims are from countries with high rates of crime and many were fleeing persecution, so publicly announcing large compensation sums can put them and their families at huge risk,"" says cano. ""it's completely unforgivable."" on wednesday, mexican interior secretary maría luisa alcaldesaidthe government was preparing ""comprehensive restitution"" for victims and defended garduño's leadership on immigration, saying mexico respects the presumption of innocence. cano and álvarez both claim garduño's actions are the sign of an agency unwilling to reform or be transparent.

conversation withalyssa pfennig, 43, who moved from indiana to mexico in 2021. the following has been edited for length and clarity. i'd wanted to live abroad my entire life. as a single mother of a 4-year-old from indiana who lived in indianapolis for 38 years, i also wondered whether i could have a better quality of life in a country less expensive than the us. since i domuch of my work remotely, i figured i could work and live anywhere. i was mostly drawn to the idea of living in mexico because i had visited a few times and liked its proximity to the us, culture, food, traditions, and language. i've now lived in mexico for over two years, and my quality of life has drastically improved. here's how i made the move and how it's benefited my daughter and me. i hired a relocation consultant whom i found on the internet for about $500 to help me determine the best place for us to live and what we needed to do to make it happen, including how to move my dog and items across the border. she also provided information on how much to budget and medical resources, recommended stores and schools, gave an overview of neighborhoods, and offered referrals to a real-estate agent, immigration lawyer, and insurance broker. the relocation consultant and i discussed options including todos santos and puerto vallarta. after i decided that i wanted to live somewhere with year-round mild weather, she recommended san miguel de allende. that summer, my daughter and i took a 10-day trip there, and i knew it was where i wanted to move. everything was easy from the moment we arrived. we found our first nanny from a referral in a facebook group, and the owner of our rental house referred us to another nanny. her sister cooked for us, and her other sister helped on the weekends so i could enjoy a working vacation. their family is still part of ours. i even met a taxi driver on our scouting visit who would wait for us while we looked at homes. he still honks and says hello when he sees me walk by now that we live here. my relocation consultant recommended not signing a lease in mexico without seeing the property first, so when we moved down, we found a place to stay for just a few weeks. i realized it was too far outside the city, and i felt isolated, so i picked another place near the city center, in colonia san antonio, that felt more upbeat and signed a lease there. i hired an immigration lawyer to help me with residency, which made the process so much easier. i attempted the traditional process, but because i had traveled to mexico before 2020, i was eligible for aspecial programthat would grant me four years oftemporary residency. i moved on a tourist visa and applied for temporary residency once the tourist visa expired. we secured mine first and later added my daughter as family. a big reason i was eager to move was that i knew i could make the same amount of money working remotely but save more and stress less about mycost of living. i moved into a brand-new 1,500-square-foot loft apartment with a giant terrace and balcony overlooking the city center — it costs $750 a month. in indiana, my apartment was smaller and not as nice or luxurious, but it cost me $1,500 a month. i pay a nanny $5.50 an hour, a fair wage here, for daily childcare while i work. there arelabor lawsin mexico that protect her, my nanny has paid holidays and an annual bonus, and i give her a raise every year. in indiana, i paidbetween $18 and $25 an hourfor a nanny. i can also afford luxuries that i never could before, including a housekeeper whom i pay $25 to clean my house each week — compared with the $125 i paid on average in the us — and a cook who costs $33 each visit and provides us with a few days' worth of meals. these rates are also fair for my area. when i moved here, the hardest part was figuring out how to take the bus, where to buy groceries, where to buy food for my dog with allergies, how to call the best taxi service, and how to get water delivered. i had a good base of spanish that i picked up from friends in college. once we arrived, i took online classes, used google translate, and learned the language faster than i thought i would just by communicating with my nanny daily. we assimilated well and got to know our neighbors. i also made new friends, including some other expatriates. i've especially connected with parents here who have children of a similar age. my parents and family still live in indiana and we visit at least once per year because i do miss them. i still have a lot of friends whom i also visit when i'm in indiana, and we stay connected on social media, too. i feel like i have a life now beyond running a business and being a mother. i work about 20 hours a week or less by hiring part-time freelancers who take on work that doesn't require my immediate attention. i use my free time to focus on hobbies that i love, from tango dancing to going on long midweek hikes, and i have a lot of time to spend with my daughter. the people i've met here don't live or work with a sense of urgency like people i knew in the us did. for example, if someone here says they'll deliver something ""ahorita,"" or right now, that can mean immediately or, say, five hours, which took some getting used to. fireworks also go off almost every night around where i live for many different reasons, such ascelebrating a saint or holidayor commemorating someone who died. i hear them sometimes at 4 or 5 in the morning, but i've learned to deal with it. i was told that mexico would either chew you up and spit you out or embrace you with open arms. the latter was true for me. i'm happy i moved here because life is easier and better than i ever could have imagined.",Positive,"Alyssa Pfennig, a single mother from Indiana, relocated to San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, in 2021. With the help of a relocation consultant, she secured housing, childcare, and legal assistance. The move has significantly improved her quality of life, reducing her cost of living and allowing her to afford luxuries like a housekeeper and cook. She has also embraced the local culture and made new friends. Despite initial challenges with language and customs, she has assimilated well and feels a sense of belonging."

""we firmly oppose the united states' sanction and prosecution against chinese entities and individuals, and the severe infringement of the lawful rights and interests of the relevant enterprises and persons,"" the chinese foreign ministry told afp news agency. ""the chinese government has been strictly cracking down on drug crimes... and we deploy the harshest control on precursor chemicals.  ""imposing pressure and sanctions cannot solve the united states' own problems. it will only create obstacles in the china-us co-operation on drug control,"" it said.  in april, a spokesperson for the chinese foreign ministry said there was ""no such thing as illegal trafficking of fentanyl"" between china and mexico. this came after mexican president andrés manuel lópez obrador called on the chinese government to help stop the alleged flow of fentanyl and its precursors into his country.  the us authorities blame mexican drug gangs for supplying fentanyl to users across the us. fentanyl can be legally prescribed by doctors, but a dramatic increase in opioid addiction in the us in recent decades has led to a rise in illegal production and overdoses. in 2022, the drug was linked to a record 109,680 deaths. the us treasury department announced sanctions against what it called a ""china-based network responsible for the manufacturing and distribution"" of precursors of fentanyl and a number of other illegal drugs.  officials say companies in the fentanyl supply chain routinely use false addresses and mislabelling to avoid their products being identified by law enforcement. those affected by the sanctions include 12 entities and 13 individuals based in china, as well as two entities and one individual based in canada, the treasury said. the sanctions will freeze the entities' us assets and bar americans from dealing with them. merrick garland is due to travel to mexico with other senior officials for meetings on how to tackle the supply of illegal drugs.  ""we know who is responsible for poisoning the american people with fentanyl,"" mr garland told reporters. ""we know that this network includes the cartels' leaders, their drug traffickers, their money launderers, their clandestine lab operators, their security forces, their weapons suppliers, and their chemical suppliers.  ""and we know that this global fentanyl supply chain, which ends with the deaths of americans, often starts with chemical companies in china."" the us justice department has also unsealed indictments charging eight chinese companies and 12 of their employees with crimes related to fentanyl and methamphetamine production, the distribution of opioids and sales resulting from precursor chemicals. no-one has been arrested and the chinese government did not work with us authorities on the investigations, mr garland said.",Negative,"The US has sanctioned 25 Chinese entities and individuals for their alleged involvement in the production of fentanyl precursors.

""that seems to be what they're thinking about with this proposal.""  the term ""wall"" itself is a misnomer. on its website, customs and border patrol describes the border barrier as including everything from picket fences to concrete and steel levees and, in places, ""normandy barriers"" - large metal barricades solely designed to stop vehicle intrusions, but passable for people on foot.  according to cbp, the new wall construction will consist of 18-foot (5.4m) steel fence panels placed in portable concrete barriers, bolstered by ""detection technology"" and lighting.  experts note that even sectors with tall, solid barriers are by no means impenetrable. migrants often find ways to climb the barriers using ladders or ropes or cut and climb through them.  ""it's really just more of a speed bump. it'll probably just take another few minutes to get into the us,"" said adam isacson, a researcher at the washington office on latin america.  ""this is not at all an insurmountable barrier. it's harder to get kids over, or the old or disabled, and a lot more people die or are badly injured falling from it. but it does not seem to deter people"".  walls, mr isaacson added, are also ""irrelevant if your goal is to turn yourself in"" and formally seek asylum - which in recent months has constituted a ""significant majority"" of the total number of migrant detentions. once across the international boundary, asylum seekers are legally permitted to challenge deportation.  along the border - where communities are long used to being at the frontlines of the immigration debate - news of the border extension has elicited mixed feelings.  several residents of border towns told the bbc that while they want a strong border they are opposed to a wall, or that they are open to the idea but are concerned about how it is implemented. one of them, eagle pass activist jessie fuentes, said that he ""fought hard"" against previous border wall construction efforts, but ultimately felt that the barriers were ""well engineered"" and ""set up strategically"".  ""fences serve a purpose,"" he said. ""if it's going to help cbp control or set up a route where migrants can find shelter or relief, then that's a good thing....but it shouldn't make people think we're walling off everything. it's a tough one."" alex garcia, a resident of webb county - which neighbours starr county - said that he ""understands"" the need for a barrier but is worried for the environmental impact and the fact that migrants ""could hurt themselves"" attempting to cross.  as a concept, border ""walls"" pre-date both president biden and former president trump. every recent us president has built or enhanced portions of barriers along the border, including 128 miles constructed during the obama administration. these barriers, experts note, have had little long-term impact on the migration flows and triggers that ultimately determine how many migrants arrive at the us-mexico border.  arturo sarukhan, who served as mexico's ambassador to the us between 2007 and 2013, said that ""you can't enforce your way out of a migration crisis"" regardless of ""red-meat politicking and dog-whistle narratives"" or a ""need to neutralise electoral pimping of the issue"".  ""you can't tackle 21st century challenges with 1st century bce solutions,"" he said. ""the only effect this will have is to further drive up profits for organized crime smuggling and trafficking people and play whack-a-mole with migration flows and crossing patterns into the us towards more perilous routes and border regions"". ",Neutral,"Starr County, Texas, a quiet border region, will see a 20-mile border wall extension despite President Biden's previous opposition. The wall's effectiveness is debated, with studies showing mixed results. While some residents support the wall for border control, others express concerns about its environmental impact and potential harm to migrants. Despite the wall's construction, experts emphasize that it is not a long-term solution to migration challenges."

""these ages were really much older than the accepted paradigm of when humans entered north america,"" said kathleen springer, one of the us geological survey researchers who wrote the report. she says scientists had thought humans might have crossed from what is now siberia to alaska toward the end of the last ice age. but if her team's analysis of the footprints was correct, maybe that was wrong, and humans found a way onto the continent even when its northern lands were still ice-bound. ""it opens up whole avenues of migratory pathways,"" she said. ""how did people get here?"" the overlapping tracks – and timeline – of humans and megafauna also opened new questions about how long the species coexisted, and what role humans might or might not have played in their extinction. critics challenged the research. another paper published in science said the dating technique used was flawed: the scientists had carbon-dated seeds fromruppia cirrhosa, a grasslike aquatic plant that lives in lakes and that was embedded along with the footprints. but aquatic plants can absorb older carbon from water, skewing the results. so, after some pandemic-related delays, the researchers returned to the excavation site, this time to carbon-date tree pollen, for better accuracy. also, they took samples of the lake bed. ""they're like tubes pounded in the sedimentary sequence and taken back to a laboratory and analyzed,"" said springer. for those samples they used a different technique called optically stimulated luminescence. it looks at the luminescent properties of quartz crystals, which change with age. today, anew paperis out with the results, and the scientists say both sets of evidence align with the dates of their original findings. jeff pigati, also from the u.s. geological survey, hopes this will close the case. ""people can argue against any single dating technique,"" he said. ""but it's the totality of the study, the congruence of the ages from all three different dating techniques, that really make our results exceptionally robust."" some skepticism lingers. loren davis, a professor of anthropology at oregon state university who co-authored the critical paper last year, said he thinks the new research is important, but not conclusive. ""i unfortunately don't share their conclusions that they have resolved the issue of timing of when people were making these footprints,"" he said. he said the samples of quartz came from the lowest deposit of the study area, and that the possible age range is broad. he also said that the sample was less useful because it was taken from a clay layer, that does not have footprints embedded in it. stringer and pigati disputed his interpretation. they said that in fact the samples that they took came from between the first and second layers of footprints that they studied, and that the clay layer is intermingled with the layers of sediments in which footprints are embedded. with findings with such broad implications, the debate is sure to continue. but in recent years, other sites that might be older than about 14,000 years have started to get more attention.researchers from vanderbilt universitybelieve the monte verde site in southern chile was established more than 15,000 years ago.archaeologists in texashave also dated human-made artifacts to as much as 15,500 years ago. ""things are changing extremely rapidly,"" said edward jolie, a professor of anthropology at the university of arizona who worked on the footprints project. ""what's exciting about the white sands discoveries is that they really forced us to entertain this notion that significant parts of what we thought we knew or understood are in need of some revision,"" he said. jolie, who is of oglala lakota and hodulgee muscogee heritage, says technology is transforming his field. but there's something else, too: more indigenous people are involved in research into these early americans. ""given that the vast majority of archaeology in the americas is the archaeology of native americans, it's particularly significant that native voices, indigenous voices have become more prominent and more accepted,"" he said. he said those new voices are asking different questions, and moving toward new answers.",Neutral,"Fossil human footprints in New Mexico suggest humans arrived in North America 21,000-23,000 years ago, earlier than previously believed.

under pressure from both parties to show decisive action at the border. in short, biden officials claim that even though he may not want to build a wall, he must, or he will face serious political consequences. but new fences are not a reversal of the democratic party’s agenda. they are part of an extensive history of both democrats and republicans selling americans on the idea that they can stop border-crossings by simply starting a new program or building a big fence. politicians from both parties have consistently attempted to “close the border,” as if doing so is actually possible, let alone desirable. biden is not continuing construction on trump’s border wall; he is continuing to build america’s border wall. read more:in reversal, biden moves to expand border wall the first border fences built along the u.s.-mexico border to curb immigration from mexico began in earnest under democrats franklin delano roosevelt and harry s. truman. afterbuilding fences for decades to stop animals, the federal government shifted its focus when people began migrating in significant numbers from south to north in the 1940s and 1950s. in this transitional moment, both mexico and the united states embraced the border’s permeability. to fill labor gaps left by world war ii, the nations agreed to a guest worker program, known as thebraceroprogram. not everyone qualified to participate, though, so thousands began migrating independently. growers in the north yearned for affordable labor. mexicans within and outside of the program provided it. under pressure to control the flow of people, the roosevelt administration began planning fence construction in urban areas to divert traffic to more isolated areas. by the end of the truman administration, most border cities were fenced. even as both nations facilitated mexican migration, they looked to fences to aid them in filtering who could enter. the bracero program ended in 1964, and a year later, democrat lyndon b. johnson signed the immigration and nationality act which, for the first time, placed a cap on the number of people who could immigrate to the u.s. from western hemisphere countries like mexico. this shift in regulation directed greater attention to the border. read more:what donald trump got right—and wrong—about the history of deportation despite new laws and fences, immigrants kept coming. lured by u.s. demand, smugglers brought drugs, too. in 1969, republican richard nixon launched operation intercept. he tried to close the border for weeks to stop the movement of illicit drugs. the initiative increased security and surveillance—a virtual fence, not a material one—but it failed by its own measure. two years later, first lady pat nixon established friendship park along the border near san diego where people could celebrate cross-border culture. at the dedication ceremony, nixon requested that her security detail cut strands of barbed wire there so that she could greet mexicans across the borderline. “i hope there won’t be a fence too long here,” the republican famously said. nixon’s administration never built significant barriers. facing economic distress and american angst with rising tides of labor migrations from mexico, democrat jimmy carter replaced the fence nixon had cut with a bigger, stronger fence in 1979. a year before it went up, its design stirred controversy when the contractor stated it would “sever the toes” of anyone who dared to breach it. after public outcry, carter’s administration redesigned the fence to be plain, but tightly woven, wire mesh topped with barbed wire. even if that fence did not sever toes, it did tear through pat nixon’s bi-nationally spirited park. republican ronald reagan also closed the border for a few weeks in 1985, repeating operation intercept. despite his idea that he could close the border at his whim, reagan, like first lady nixon, demonstrated hesitation about actual border fences. in a1980 debatewith future president george h.w. bush, reagan had said, “rather than talking about putting up a fence, why don’t we work out some recognition of our mutual problems, make it possible for them to come here legally with a work permit and then while they’re working and earning here they pay taxes here.” reagan later signed the 1986 immigration reform and control act. the law provided legalization to over two million undocumented immigrants who had been working in the united states, increased the legal culpability for employers who hired undocumented people, and provided funding for more border patrol agents. although reagan did not build fences, his administration did maintain the ones that existed, and he provided funds to increase border surveillance, as did george h.w. bush. in the 1990s intense xenophobia and public debate about unauthorized immigration escalated in the united states,prompting both parties to move toward physically securing the border.democrat bill clinton’s policies would not just tear through pat nixon’s park, they would effectively destroy it. in 1993 and 1994, clinton launched three separate border operations: operation hold the line in texas, operation safeguard in arizona, and operation gatekeeper in southern california. read more:barriers to a border wall the fences were part of what clinton referred to as a“get tough policy at our borders.”he used steel surplus military landing mats, which the army corps of engineers welded together, to build an allegedly impassable wall. in the middle of friendship park, the immigration and naturalization service built three parallel fences. multiple fences, they argued, would allow agents to catch fence-jumpers in between them. clinton’s barriers to humans went up alongside nafta, which opened the border to material goods, once again making the border more of a sieve than a seal. instead of stopping people from crossing, a more militarized border diverted them to dangerous landscapes, increasing migrant deaths exponentially. in the decade following clinton’s fences,deaths along the border doubled. like his father, george w. bush began his presidency hoping to build bridges with mexico. he floated the idea of reviving and expanding a bracero-style guest worker program to allow mexicans to work in the united states legally. he made that recommendation consistently,even after the terrorist attacks of 2001. but reacting to those same attacks also led bush and congress to tighten border security and ultimately abandon his plan. in 2006, bush signed the secure fence act, authorizing 700 miles of double-layered, reinforced fencing. when he left office, he had completed more than 500 miles. barack obama continued the work, building 130 more miles of fencing. he also famously funded the border patrol and deported more people than any president before him. read more:trump's immigration crackdown seems designed to spread fear although donald trump championed building his wall, his administration only built about 85 miles of new fences. biden will now add 20 more. additional fencing will do what previous fencing has done: impose severe harm—on the environment, on borderland communities, livestock, and most of all on the human beings hoping to cross who will be diverted into costlier and deadlier routes. fences have transformed the borderlands into a racialized graveyard, but they have not and will not stop people from migrating if doing so is a matter of survival. in a future where climate crises and political unrest is certain, so too are continued waves of migration. fences cannot “close the border” because borders are never simply open or shut. and the costs of making them impenetrable are grave. as it stands, fences are piecemeal and violent. and historically, republicans have been less inclined to build them than democrats. there are currently 700 miles of non-contiguous fences along the 1,951-mile border. a republican built most of those, but we cannot ignore that democrats have also built and supported their fair share, showing bipartisan commitment to this symbol of illusory control. biden has not made an about-face, he is simply continuing an interminable trend of border-building policies and now, like many who came before him, he has fallen into the same, familiar, repetitive pattern.

""people don't pick up and leave their homes just for the heck of it,"" janet napolitano, head of homeland security during the obama administration, told the bbc. ""they're usually in desperate straits - poverty, joblessness, high crime, violence, lack of civil institutions in their countries of origin."" on thursday, the biden administration announced two new steps to address the dramatic increase - and both have opened the president up to attacks from across the political spectrum. the president issued a series of environmental and planning waivers and released funds to build additional sections of wall along the us-mexico border.  he also revealed that the us would resume direct deportations of venezuelan citizens - a practice that had been suspended because of tense diplomatic relations between the two nations. these new measures were quickly denounced as too little by immigration hard-liners and too much by left-wing immigration activists. the president's muddled explanations - that he still believes walls don't work and that it was money he was forced by congress to spend - compounded the situation. the venezuelan announcement also represents a change in attitude by the administration, after moves last month to allow approximately half a million venezuelan refugees in the us to apply for work permits and avoid deportation for 18 months.  in trying to assuage concerns that he is not doing enough to address the border surge while also keeping his liberal supporters happy, he appears to be satisfying no one - a conundrum that has played itself out repeatedly on border policy throughout the biden presidency. immigration has become an intensely polarising issue, due in no small part to mr trump's ""build the wall"" rhetoric and sometimes draconian policies during his presidency. that has greatly curtailed mr biden's political flexibility in dealing with the crises.  where barack obama was able to increase deportations and strengthen border security during his presidency without facing damaging blowback from liberal activists, mr biden has no such luxury. every step he takes on immigration is now viewed in the context of the current environment of partisan political trench warfare, with mr trump and the republicans on one side and the democrats on the other. meanwhile, recent polling suggests that in that partisan fight, the public is turning on the president. respondents in a new marquette university poll of registered voters were asked to choose who was ""better"" on the issue of immigration and border security, the current president or the man he replaced. fifty-two percent said they preferred mr trump, while only 28% opted for mr biden. that is tied with the economy for the largest issue gap between the two candidates and stands in contrast to topics like abortion and climate change, where mr biden has solid leads. those results were mirrored in an nbc news poll, which found 45% of americans thought republicans were better at dealing with immigration versus only 27% for democrats. it represents a marked change from the trump presidency, when pluralities of the us public preferred the democrats. the steady drumbeat of disturbing news from the border, as well as the strain on public services felt by the major us cities where the migrants are settling, is making a noticeable mark on public opinion.  and if the crisis does not ease before the 2024 general election campaign begins in earnest, the president will be taking on his republican opponent on unfavourable political terrain. according to ms napolitano, solving the immigration crisis will take a concerted effort from the biden team. ""it requires diplomatic outreach,"" she says. ""it requires investment in other countries so that we take away some of the incentive to migrate. and it requires strong border security and effective enforcement of our immigration laws, which need to be amended and reformed."" in the end, the criticism mr biden receives for his actions on immigration this week will be much less important than whether or not the new policies work. if they don't, and if the biden administrations other steps to staunch the flow of migrants from venezuela and elsewhere are also unsuccessful, his path to re-election becomes more perilous.",Negative,"President Biden faces political challenges due to the surge in migrants at the US-Mexico border. Critics from both parties and declining public support threaten his re-election hopes. The crisis stems from factors such as the Venezuelan refugee crisis and Republican governors sending migrants to Democratic cities. Biden's recent measures, including border wall construction and Venezuelan deportations, have drawn criticism from both sides. The issue has become highly polarized, with the public favoring Republicans on immigration. If the crisis persists, Biden's path to re-election could be jeopardized."

""texas installed razor wire in eagle pass to stop illegal crossings. today the biden admin cut that wire, opening the floodgates to illegal immigrants. i immediately deployed more texas national guard to repel illegal crossings& install more razor wire,"" he posted on x. but the lawsuit filed last week goes farther in its accusation of wrongdoing, claiming federal agents are destroying the wire to ""encourage and assist thousands of aliens to illegally cross the rio grande."" the lawsuit is also likely to affect the relationship between cbp and texas state authorities that gov. abbott has attempted to authorize to enforce federal immigration law, like texas dps and the texas national guard. it also comes as texan lawmakers are close to approving house bill 4, which would authorize local and state law enforcement officials to arrest migrants and return them ""to the foreign nation from which the person entered or attempted to enter.""  ""this is just another example of texas refusing to accept the fact that it's the responsibility of the federal government to enforce the immigration laws and secure the border, not the responsibility of the state,"" said tom jawetz, a senior fellow at center for american progress and former deputy general counsel for dhs. the lawsuit raises several legal questions about whether texas can prevent federal agents from enforcing immigration and asylum laws. in areas like eagle pass, texas, the concertina wire is placed on the northern and u.s. side of the rio grande river, which means migrants who reach it are already on u.s. soil and legally allowed to enter through for apprehension and processing. ""you find actually, a lot of the actual wall structures in texas are well within u.s. territory. even for the portion from the international boundary line, up to that wall, anyone standing in that area has equal rights under the law to seek asylum as someone standing north of whatever boundary line,"" said elissa steglich, a clinical professor and co-director of the immigration clinic at the university of texas school of law. the department of homeland security declined to comment on the lawsuit, but added that it would abide by the court’s order. ""we do not comment on pending litigation. generally speaking, border patrol agents have a responsibility under federal law to take those who have crossed onto u.s. soil without authorization into custody for processing, as well as to act when there are conditions that put our workforce or migrants at risk. we will, of course, comply with the order issued by the court this morning,” a dhs spokesperson said. during an interview with abc news correspondent matt rivers in september, usbp chief jason owens alluded to the fact that agents can’t simply prevent people from entering the u.s. ""so i think there's a lot of misunderstanding about what border patrol agents can and can't do. we see a lot of a lot of folks say just push people back, just don't let them cross or send them back immediately. the u.s. border patrol is a law enforcement agency, we enforce the laws that are on the books, we don't have the right, nor should we, to deny somebody due process once they are on american soil…you don't want a law enforcement agency that goes rogue and doesn't adhere to those principles,"" he said.",Neutral,"A federal judge has temporarily barred the federal government from removing concertina wire placed by Texas authorities near the US-Mexico border.

america’s national security” as he prepared to ask congress for billions of dollars in military assistance for both countries. “history has taught us when terrorists don’t pay a price for their terror, when dictators don’t pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos and death and more destruction,” biden said. “they keep going. and the cost and the threat to america and the world keep rising.” read more:as u.s. downs israel-bound missiles from yemen, biden faces risk of escalation biden’s speech reflected an expansive view of u.s. obligations overseas at a time when he faces

earlier. there’s also $14 billion for israel, $10 billion for unspecified humanitarian efforts, $14 billion for managing the u.s.-mexico border and fighting fentanyl trafficking, and $7 billion for the indo-pacific region, which includes taiwan. the proposal was described by three people familiar with the details who insisted on anonymity before the official announcement. “it’s a smart

where he showed solidarity with the country after theoct. 7 attack by hamasand pushed for more humanitarian assistance to palestinians. with israel continuing to bombard the gaza strip and preparing a ground invasion, biden placed an increased emphasis on the deadly toll that the conflict has had on civilians there, saying he's “heartbroken by the tragic loss of palestinian life.” “israel and palestinians equally deserve to live in safety, dignity and peace,” biden said. he also warned about a rising tide of antisemitism and islamophobia in the u.s., notingthe killing of wadea alfayoumi, a 6-year-old palestinian-american boy. “to all you hurting, i want you to know i see you. you belong,” biden said. “and i want to say this to you. you’re all americans.” read more:the israel-hamas war

russia’s invasion of ukraine, and said the u.s. “will continue to hold them accountable.” as biden seeks a second term in a campaign that will likely hinge on voters’ feeling about the economy, he was careful to emphasize that the spending will create jobs for u.s. workers, referencing the construction of missiles in arizona and artillery shells in pennsylvania, ohio, and texas. and he worked in a nod to one of his political heroes, franklin delano roosevelt, by saying that “just as in world war ii,” the country is “building the arsenal of democracy and serving the cause of freedom.” biden faces an array of steep challenges as he tries to secure the money. the house remains in chaos because the republican majority has been unable to select a speaker to replace rep. kevin mccarthy, who

budget legislation last month despite a personal plea fromukrainian president volodymyr zelensky. there will be resistance from some on the other side of the political spectrum when it comes to military assistance for israel, which has been bombarding the gaza strip in response to the hamas attack on oct. 7. critics have accused israel of indiscriminately killing civilians and committing war

democrats have become more outspoken in their opposition to the country’s decades-long occupation of palestinian territory, which is widely viewed as illegal by the international community. there are

policy on weapons transfers to israel. “i cannot work in support of a set of major policy decisions, including rushing more arms to one side of the conflict, that i believe to be short-sighted, destructive, unjust and contradictory to the very values that we publicly espouse,” he wrote in a statement posted to his linkedin account. a speech from the oval office is one of the most prestigious platforms that a president can command, an opportunity to try to seize the country’s attention at a moment of crisis. the major television networks broke into regular programming to carry the address live. biden has delivered only one other such speech during his presidency, after congress passed bipartisan budget legislation to avert a default on the country’s debt. the white house and other senior administration officials, including office of management and budget director shalanda young, have quietly briefed key lawmakers in recent days about the contours of the planned supplemental funding request. the democratic senate plans to move quickly on biden’s proposal, hoping that it creates pressure on the republican-controlled house to resolve its leadership drama and return to legislating. read more:house republicans show where israel ranks (right behind their infighting) however, there are disagreements within the senate, too, on how to move forward. eight republicans, led by kansas sen. roger marshall, said they did not want to combine assistance for ukraine and israel in the same legislation. “these are two separate and unrelated conflicts and it would be wrong to leverage support of aid to israel in an attempt to get additional aid for ukraine across the finish line,” they wrote in a letter. north dakota sen. kevin cramer said he was fine with the proposal as long as there was also a fresh effort to address border issues. but he said “it’s got to be designed to secure the border, not to facilitate travel through the border.” although there was a lull in migrant arrivals to the u.s. after the start of new asylum restrictions in may, illegal crossings topped a daily average of more than 8,000 last month. sen. chris murphy, a connecticut democrat who leads a senate panel that oversees funding for the department of homeland security, was wary of any effort to overhaul border policy during a debate over spending. “how are we going to settle our differences over immigration in the next two weeks?” murphy said. “this is a supplemental funding bill. the minute you start loading it up with policies, that sounds like a plan to fail.” biden’s decision to include funding for the indo-pacific in his proposal is a nod toward the potential for another international conflict.china wants to reunify the self-governing island of taiwan with its mainland, a goal that could be carried out through force. although wars in europe and the middle east have been the most immediate concerns for u.s. foreign policy, biden views asia as the key arena in the struggle for global influence. the administration’s national security strategy, released last year, describes china as “america’s most consequential geopolitical challenge.” —associated press

""girlfriend"" (the track) is a neat summation of the entire project. sweet slashes through the guitar chords while maher provides solid, unfussy percussion, and quine adds his unique, fauvist guitar approach. the vocals and guitars are mixed loudly, and harmony vocals add detail to a robust and insistent tune. it even gave him a top 5 single on the billboard modern rock tracks chart.finally, sweet had found his voice. aurally, girlfriend is as dry as a bone. reverb is off-limits, and the mixing is straight out of the ""beatles in stereo"" book. instruments and voices are hard-panned to the left or right, resulting in the listener being placed in the center of the performances. the studio credo was ""first take = best take"", which added to the songs' raw feel.  both sweet and quine were working through their demons during the sessions; specifically, sweet was coping with the breakdown of his marriage and the pressure on him to remain a working musician, whereas quine was dealing with numerous mental health issues. both musicians channeled their angst into the recordings, ensuring that sweet's perfectly conceived pop compositions had a harsh, jagged edge. yin and yang. the tracks are as varied as a truck stop jukebox, but they all hang together beautifully. for instance, ""girlfriend"", ""holy war"", and ""does she talk?"" are tight and aggressive rockers. on the other hand, ""nothing lasts"" and ""winona"" are plaintive ballads, just as ""i wanted to tell you"" and ""i've been waiting"" are definitive examples of power-pop. sweet combines all the elements of that often-derided genre in the latter piece, creating something that can hold its head high next to ""september gurls"" and ""i feel fine"". from sweet's ringing arpeggios to richard lloyd's short but stinging solo (via a vocal melody that's so perfect and timeless), it'll have you fruitlessly working through your record collection looking for its antecedents. it's become the benchmark for guitar pop. you should take some time today and listen to the whole album. and also enjoy thisgreat short set—which includes two of the best songs from the album, ""girlfriend"" and ""i've been waiting""—from april, 1992. just skip ahead 40 seconds so you don't have to see or hear dennis miller.",Positive,"Matthew Sweet's ""Girlfriend"" album, released 32 years ago, is considered a masterpiece of power pop.

mexican-born woman to go to space in 2022. the essay has been edited for length and clarity. i was born in guadalajara, mexico. my childhood there was a bit difficult, not necessarily because we were in mexico, but rather because of my sister's situation. my older sister has mental and physical disabilities, and she got meningitis when she was very small, leaving her with epilepsy, paralysis down half her body, and the mental state of about an 8-year-old child. this happened in the '90s, and the medical care necessary to take care of somebody like my sister wasn't available in mexico. so my parents made the decision to immigrate to california when i was 7 years old. the transition was difficult for me, mostly because i didn't speak english. i've always been the kind of kid that found comfort and a happy place in school. but in the classroom in the us, i would sit for hours and hours, but everything was nonsense to me because i didn't understand english. i started to fall behind, and was also made fun of. knowing you're bullied but not knowing what it's about because you don't understand what they're saying — it just feeds into it more. learning english became my number-one priority. if i was going to learn about space and science — which i'd always been curious and passionate about — i knew i needed to master the language. everything in my life needed to be in english, from the books and articles i read, to the tv shows and movies i watched. i only spoke spanish to my mom, who still hadn't learned english at that point. i learned how to communicate basic language by the time i was in the fourth grade, which was a year later. by the fifth grade, i was already reading, writing, and speaking at a fifth-grader's level. and then, by the time i made it to the sixth grade, i was reading, writing, and speaking at an eighth-grade level. i had a binder in early elementary school, where i had a section for the different planets in our solar system. we hooked up my first computer i'd gotten for christmas to the family printer, and, anytime i learned anything new about the planets, i'd print it out and add it to my binder. for example, i had a section on mars, and if i learned anything new about its composition, temperature, or how long its days are, i'd add those little bits of information, so i had my own little scientific journal of everything i was learning. after that, my interest and education in space became more formalized. i signed myself up for online astronomy classes when i was in elementary school using my mom's name. i did my homework and took the tests — nobody probably knew it was a 12-year-old child. i went to ucla for college and majored in electrical engineering, and i landed my dream job at nasa's jet propulsion laboratory as an intern before i was hired full time. working at nasa was surreal. the jet propulsion lab is in charge of all the robotics-led missions, likecuriosity,galileo, andjuno— these missions that havetaught us so much about our solar system. i have these moments where i snap back into the reality of my job and realize that my normal workday and paperwork is what's helping themars rover take its first test drive. in 2019, i heard about space for humanity, a non-profit program that sent citizen astronauts into space. i applied almost immediately. i didn't hear back until three years later, but during that time, i completed a space training program where i did training with microgravity, g-force, and pressurized spacesuits. when i heardi was selectedout of 7,000 applicants from over 120 countries, i had to jump on psychological training, because my mission was to analyze the effects on a human being when you're able to look at the planet from the outside. that training proved to be crucial for when i finally went up to space on theblue origin ns-21 missionin june 2022. i wanted to be excited, of course, but not to the point where i was stressed or anxious. i learned how to visualize myself in the capsule whenever i felt relaxed to associate myself being in the capsule with being calm. and it worked. it's such an incredible thing to understand as you're going up to space that not only is it you doing this and seeing the sights, but you're also considered the first, and one of the very few people that have done it. and thateven fewer of those are women. when you consider how fewer than 800 people have ever been able to see what you're seeing right now — it's a mix of so many different thoughts, feelings, and also a massive understanding of the privilege you have in the moment. i'd always known that a mexican-born woman hadn't traveled into space before because i'd been obsessed with this topic for so long. i knew aboutjosé hernández, i knew aboutellen ochoa, i knew aboutrodolfo neri vela, the first mexican-born individual to travel to space nearly 40 years ago. and i knew that all of this had happened a very long time ago. so when i was selected for this, i understood that it wasn't something that just meant a lot to me, but rather that this was going to be something that is very major for an entire community. i understood i had a big load to carry, and that i had to manage the newfound attention with respect. i've since startedfundación espacial, a foundation that provides opportunities for people in our communities to explore the space industry. it's become part of my job to not only continue to help others feel inspired, but also to open up more doors so that they can potentially achieve something like this, so that it doesn't take another 40 years.",Neutral,"Katya Echazarreta, a Mexican-born electrical engineer, became the first Mexican woman in space in 2022.

him at a transit station. deng guangsen, 28, had spent the last two months traveling to san diego from the southern chinese province of guangdong, through seven countries on plane, bus and foot, including traversing panama’s dangerous darién gap jungle. “i feel nothing,” deng said in the san diego parking lot, insisting on using the broken english he learned from the “harry potter” film series. “i have no brother, no sister. i have nobody.” deng is part of a major influx of chinese migration to the united states on a relatively new and perilous route that has become increasingly popular with the help of social media. chinese people were the fourth-highest nationality, after venezuelans, ecuadorians, and haitians, crossing the darién gap during the first nine months of this year, according to panamanian immigration authorities. chinese asylum-seekers who spoke to the associated press, as well as observers, say they are seeking to escape an increasingly repressive political climate and bleak economic prospects. they also reflect a broader presence of migrants at the u.s.-mexico border — asians, south americans, and africans — who made september the second-highest month of illegal crossings and the u.s. government’s 2023 budget year the second-highest on record. the pandemic and china’s covid-19 policies, which included tight border controls, temporarily stemmed the exodus that rose dramatically in 2018 when president xi jinping amended the constitution to scrap the presidential term limit. now emigration has resumed, withchina’s economy struggling to reboundandyouth unemployment high. the united nations has projected china will lose 310,000 people through emigration this year, compared with 120,000 in 2012. read more:china’s aging population is a major concern. but its youth may be an even bigger problem it has become known as “runxue,” or the study of running away. the term started as a way to get around censorship, using a chinese character whose pronunciation spells like the english word “run” but means “moistening.” now it’s an internet meme. “this wave of emigration reflects despair toward china,” cai xia, editor-in-chief of the online commentary site of yibao and a former professor at the central party school of the chinese communist party in beijing. “they’ve lost hope for the future of the country,” said cai, who now lives in the u.s. “you see among them the educated and the uneducated, white-collar workers, as well as small business owners, and those from well-off families.” those who can’t get a visa are finding other ways to flee the world’s most populous nation. many are showing up at the u.s.-mexico border to seek asylum. the border patrol made 22,187 arrests of chinese for crossing the border illegally from mexico from january through september, nearly 13 times the same period in 2022. arrests peaked at 4,010 in september, up 70% from august. the vast majority were single adults. the popular route to the u.s. is through ecuador, which has no visa requirements for chinese nationals. migrants from china join latin americans there to trek north through the once-impenetrable darién and across several central american countries before reaching the u.s. border. the journey is well-known enough it has its own name in chinese: walk the line, or “zouxian.” read more:how panama became the most treacherous crossing point for migrants on a long journey to the u.s. the monthly number of chinese migrants crossing the darién has been rising gradually, from 913 in january to 2,588 in september. for the first nine months of this year, panamanian immigration authorities registered 15,567 chinese citizens crossing the darién. by comparison, 2,005 chinese people trekked through the rainforest in 2022, and just 376 in total from 2010 to 2021. short video platforms and messaging apps provide not only on-the-ground video clips but also step-by-step guides from china to the u.s., including tips on what to pack, where to find guides, how to survive the jungle, which hotels to stay at, how much to bribe police in different countries and what to do when encountering u.s. immigration officers. translation apps allow migrants to navigate through central america on their own, even if they don’t speak spanish or english. the journey can cost thousands to tens of thousands of dollars, paid for with family savings or even online loans. it’s markedly different from the days when chinese nationals paid smugglers, known as snakeheads, and traveled in groups. with more financial resources, xi yan, 46, and her daughter song siming, 24, didn’t trek the ecuador-mexico route, but instead flew into mexico via europe. with help from a local guide, the two women crossed the border at mexicali into the u.s. in april. “the unemployment rate is very high. people cannot find work,” said xi yan, a chinese writer. “for small business owners, they cannot sustain their businesses.” read more:china’s solution to inequality? cracking down on displays of wealth and poverty xi yan said she decided to leave china in march, when she traveled to the southern city of foshan to see her mother but had to leave the next day when state security agents and police officers harassed her brother and told him that his sister was not allowed in the city. she realized she was still on the state blacklist, six years after being detained for gathering at a seaside spot to remember liu xiaobo, a nobel peace laureate who died in a chinese prison. in 2015, she was locked up for 25 days over an online post remembering the victims of the 1989 tiananmen massacre. her daughter, song, agreed to leave with her. a college graduate, the daughter struggled to find work in china and became depressed, the mother said. despite the challenges to survive in the u.s., xi yan said it was worth it. “we have freedom,” she said. “i used to get nervous whenever there was a police car. now, i don’t have to worry about it anymore.” migrants hoping to enter the u.s. at san diego wait for agents to pick them up in an area between two border walls or in remote mountains east of the city covered with shrubs and large boulders. many migrants are released with court dates in cities nearest their final destination in a bottlenecked system that takes years to decide cases. chinese migrants had an asylum grant rate of 33% in the 2022 budget year, compared with 46% for all nationalities, according to syracuse university’stransactional records access clearinghouse. read more:tens of thousands seek asylum in the u.s. who gets to stay? catholic charities of san diego uses hotels to provide shelters for migrants, including 1,223 from china in september. the average shelter stay

going to new york, they’re going to chicago, they’re going to all kinds of places,” said vino pajanor, the group’s chief executive. “they don’t want to be in a shelter.” in september, 98% of u.s. border arrests of chinese people occurred in the san diego area. at the transit stop, migrants charge phones, snack, browse piles of free clothing, and get travel advice. signs at portable bathrooms and information booths and a volunteer’s loudspeaker announcements about free airport shuttles are translated to multiple languages, including mandarin. taxi drivers offer rides to los angeles. many migrants who spoke to the ap did not give their full names out of fear of drawing attention to their cases. some said they came for economic reasons and paid 300,000 to 400,000 yuan ($41,000 to $56,000 for the trip). in recent weeks, chinese migrants have filled makeshift encampments in the california desert as they wait to turn themselves in to u.s. authorities to make asylum claims. read

volunteers who distribute bottled water, hot oatmeal, and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. chen yixiao said he endured a hard journey to come to the u.s. he said life had become difficult back home, with some migrants experiencing issues with the government and others failing in business. “i’m very happy to be in the u.s. now. this is my dream country,” said chen, who planned to join his relatives in new york and find work there. at san diego’s transit station, deng was headed to monterey park, a los angeles suburb that became known as “little taipei” in the 1980s. but when he didn’t provide the border patrol with a u.s. address, an agent scheduled an initial immigration court appearance for him in new york in february. deng said he worked a job in guangdong requiring him to ride motorcycles, which he considered unsafe. as he lingered at the transit station, sitting on a curb with his small backpack, several africans approached to ask questions. he told them he arrived in the

flooding in the resort city of acapulco and setting off looting as desperate relatives tired of waiting for help to arrive. while little is known about possible deaths or the full extent of the damage — acapulco was still mostly inaccessible by road as of late wednesday — experts are calling otis the strongest storm in history to make landfall along the eastern pacific coast. many of the once sleek beachfront hotels looked like toothless shattered hulks, after hurricane otis blew out hundreds — and possibly thousands — of hotel windows. choked with mud and debris, with no electricity or internet service, the pacific coast resort descended into chaos after the storm, as thousands engaged in massive looting. the hurricane had dissipated over the mountains by wednesday afternoon, but left devastation in its wake. jakob sauczuk was staying with a group of friends at a beachfront hotel when otis hit. “we laid down on the floor and some between beds,” sauczuk said. “we prayed a lot.” one of his friends showed reporters photos of the windowless, shattered rooms in the hotel. it looked as if someone had put clothes, beds and furniture in a blender, leaving a shredded mess. he complained that his group was given no warning, nor were offered safer shelter, by the hotel. pablo navarro, an auto parts worker who was lodged in temporary accommodations at a beachfront hotel, thought he might die in his 13th story hotel room. “i took shelter in the bathroom, and thankfully the door held,” said navarro. “but there were some rooms where the wind blew out the windows and the doors.” navarro said authorities seemed to have been blindsided by the hurricane's rapid intensification. he stood wednesday outside a discount grocery and household goods store near the hotel zone, as hundreds of people wrestled everything from packs of hot dogs and toilet paper to flat screen tvs out of the muddy store, struggling to push loaded metal shopping carts onto the mud-choked streets outside. “this is out of control, “ he said. acapulco's diamond zone, an oceanfront area replete with hotels, restaurants and other tourist attractions, looked to be mostly underwater in drone footage that foro tv posted online wednesday afternoon, with boulevards and bridges completely hidden by an enormous lake of brown water. large buildings had their walls and roofs partially or completely ripped off. dislodged solar panels, cars and debris littered the lobby of one severely damaged hotel. people wandered up to their waists in water in some areas, while on other less-flooded streets soldiers shoveled rubble and fallen palm fronds from the pavement. while much of the city was in the dark and without phone service, some people were able to use satellite phones loaned by the red cross to let family members know they were ok. alicia galindo, a 28-year-old stylist in the central mexican city of san luis potosí, was one of the lucky ones to get such a call. her parents and brother were staying in acapulco’s hotel princess for an international mining conference when otis hit. they told her the worst part of the storm was between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. when ""windows began to fall, floors broke up, mattresses flew, hallways collapsed, doors fell down ... until everything was gone,” she said in a telephone interview with the associated press. fortunately, they escaped unhurt, she said. however, galindo had yet to hear from her boyfriend, who was attending the same conference but staying in a different hotel. “everybody is trying to find something out ... but no one knows anything,"" she said anxiously. the main highway into acapulco was blocked by landslides for most of wednesday, complicating efforts to reach people and effectively cutting off the city from essential resources. by late wednesday, the roadway had been cleared only for emergency vehicles, authorities announced. flor campos trudged for more than an hour through mud along a highway outside acapulco on wednesday morning before she peeled off her shoes, worried she'd lose them in the muck. the domestic worker from a small town in guerrero was among dozens of families, women and children who clambered over tree trunks and other debris left by landslides in the mountainous terrain. it was a daunting escape, but people were desperate to get out. “we had been waiting since 3 in the morning to get out, so we decided to walk. it was more dangerous to stay.” campos said. on tuesday, otis took many by surprise when it rapidly strengthened from a tropical storm to a powerful category 5 as it tore along the coast. researchers tracking the storm told the associated press that the storm broke records for how quickly it intensified, at a time when climate change has exacerbated devastating weather events like this one. “it’s one thing to have a category 5 hurricane make landfall somewhere when you’re expecting it or expecting a strong hurricane, but to have it happen when you’re not expecting anything to happen is truly a nightmare,” said brian mcnoldy, a hurricane researcher at the university of miami. acapulco, tecpan and other towns along the costa grande in guerrero were hit hard, said mexican president andrés manuel lópez obrador. he said conditions were so bad that communication with the area had been “completely lost."" acapulco is a city of nearly 1 million people at the foot of steep mountains. luxury homes and slums alike cover the city’s hillsides with views of the glistening pacific. once drawing hollywood stars for its nightlife, sport fishing and cliff diving shows, acapulco has in more recent years fallen victim to competing organized crime groups that have sunk the city into violence, driving many international tourists to the caribbean waters of cancun and the riviera maya or beaches farther down the pacific coast in the state of oaxaca. damage to the local military airport made it hard for authorities to access the region, lópez obrador said. mexico’s secretary of national defense told the ap on wednesday that 7,000 military personnel had been deployed to the area, and that over 1,200 more were on their way. officials also said they were working to restore power and phone service. lópez obrador noted that otis was a stronger hurricane than pauline, which hit acapulco in 1997, destroying swaths of the city and killing more than 300 people. ___ follow ap’s climate coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment ___ associated press writers maría verza in mexico city and seth borenstein in

""senate democrats will move expeditiously on this request, and we hope that our republican colleagues across the aisle will join us to pass this much-needed funding.” biden's national security adviser, jake sullivan, told reporters on friday that russia's ongoing invasion of ukraine and hamas' attack on israel represent a “global inflection point."" “this budget request is critical to advancing america’s national security and ensuring the safety of the american people,” sullivan said. the biggest line item in the supplemental funding request is $61.4 billion to support ukraine. some of that money will go to replenishing pentagon stockpiles of weapons that have already been provided. ukraine has struggled to make progress in a grueling counteroffensive, and the white house has warned that russia could gain ground if the united states does not rush more weapons and ammunition to the conflict. “the world is closely watching what congress does next,” sullivan said. israel would receive $14.3 billion in assistance under the proposal. the majority of that money would help with air and missile defense systems, according to the white house. some republicans in both the house and the senate are wary of linking funding for ukraine and israel. rep. roger williams, r-texas, said the president’s proposal was discussed in a closed-door meeting of his state’s republican delegation on friday. “you can't blend the two together,” he said, describing israel as “our friend forever.” williams said biden's proposal is “a little disturbing"" because ""he knows he can’t get it done without israel.” the reaction is emblematic of how biden's decision to roll together several different issues, in hopes of broadening the potential political coalition to ensure the legislation's passage, could also lead it to its derailment. debates over immigration will likely be the most thorny as republicans seek to bolster enforcement. some republicans have said they won’t support the measure unless new policies are added, and it is so far unclear whether the money that biden is requesting would be sufficient. a group of republican senators huddled on thursday to discuss possible proposals that they would support. shalanda young, the director of the office of management and budget, suggested it would be hypocritical for them to oppose biden's proposal after complaining about lax border management. “we will not be lectured by those who refuse to act,"" she said. ""as we’ve said repeatedly, congress needs to take action to provide sufficient resources for the border.” although there was a lull in migrant arrivals to the u.s. after the start ofnew asylum restrictions in may, illegal crossings topped a daily average of more than 8,000 last month. the white house wants roughly $14 billion to, among other things, boost the number of border agents, install new inspection machines to detect fentanyl and increase staffing to process asylum cases. sen. bill hagerty, a tennessee republican, said providing the administration with “more money to fuel its disastrous open-borders resettlement operation is insanity.” ""it would worsen the border crisis, not stop it,"" he wrote on x, formerly known as twitter. biden's funding request includes $7.4 billion for a variety of initiatives geared toward the indo-pacific, where the u.s. is focused on countering china's influence. the money is divided among joint security initiatives in the region, bolstering submarine manufacturing as part of a partnership with australia and developing financing programs for countries that would otherwise rely on beijing. another $9.15 billion is geared toward humanitarian efforts in ukraine, israel, gaza and other places. administration officials said they would determine where best to direct the money once it's approved. connecticut rep. rosa delauro, the top democrat on the house appropriations committee, said “time is of the essence” for passing the legislation. “we will be judged on how the united states responds to ongoing crises, whether we honor our commitments to our allies abroad, and how we care for innocent people around the world caught in the wake of devastation,” she said. associated press writer kevin freking contributed to this report.",Neutral,"The White House has proposed a $105 billion supplemental funding package to support Ukraine, Israel, domestic defense manufacturing, humanitarian aid, and border management.

""we're not going forward today,"" judge christopher lopez said at a hearing on tuesday in the southern district of texas bankruptcy court in houston. ""there's not enough time. people are entitled to the time."" the bankrupt company, tehum, formerly known as corizon health, was once the nation's leading prison health provider. as lawsuits mounted against corizon over claims of negligent care and prisoner deaths on its watch, the companypulled a controversial maneuver, the texas two-step, that involved splitting the company in two. one company, yescare, got the active prison contracts; the other, tehum, got saddled with most of corizon's debt and went into bankruptcy. the case has drawn national attention afterrevelationsthat the judge serving as mediator was in a secret romantic relationship with an attorney representing yescare. corizon's two-step has also been sharply criticized by lawmakers, including sen. elizabeth warren, who haspromised congressional oversight. attorneys representing plaintiffs in the malpractice suits against corizon said the deal would effectively allow investors to walk away with valuable assets while leaving the prisoners and their families with table scraps. at tuesday's hearing, lopez said creditors deserve more information about the parties involved in the bankruptcy and more time to review the proposed deal before it's sent out for a vote. ""there are still parties involved — and how they're connected, and what they do, and how this deal came to be, and how much money has been transferred, and whether the funding agreement was right,"" lopez said. ""there is a bunch of information that i've been asking for from the beginning of the case, well before we ever got to mediation, and those questions have yet to be answered."" lopez later added, ""i think the fundamental deal has to be reconsidered in light of what i'm saying."" jason s. brookner, an attorney for tehum, downplayed lopez's remarks, saying by email, ""he said he wasn't hearing us yesterday and we should find another date and re-set it."" many of the creditors, lopez noted, are people without timely access to mail — a clear reference to the incarcerated plaintiffs. lopez's decision comes weeks after insiderfirst raised questionsabout the fairness of the settlement, reporting that it would offer current and former prisoners a few cents on the dollar. the settlement deal would resolve hundreds of the malpractice suits for just $5,000 each — even those from families suing on behalf of loved ones who they say died due to corizon's neglect. during the hearing, lopez obliquely referenced the suddenresignationof the bankruptcy court's chief justice, david jones, on sunday, saying, ""a lot has come out"" about the mediation process that led to the deal. insiderwas the first to report allegationsthat jones, who oversaw those talks, was involved in a previously undisclosed romantic relationship with a prominent bankruptcy attorney, elizabeth freeman, his former clerk. freeman represented yescare in the negotiations. ""i have no visibility into the mediation,"" ha nguyen, an attorney with the houston office of the us trustee, said at the hearing. ""but what we do know is that there was a lawyer involved with the mediator that was in the room. that fact is concerning to people."" the office of the us trustee, an arm of the justice department, took the rare step of filinga 16-page objectionto the settlement on friday. the objection not only raised the conflicts surrounding jones' mediation of the talks, but the unique disclosure needs of incarcerated plaintiffs. ""the circumstances of this case, with a vulnerable population of creditors that face obstacles to participation even on regular notice, weigh in favor of requiring more time,"" the objection reads. ""moreover, recent admissions by the judicial mediator may raise issues about the propriety of the mediation that serves as the basis for the global settlement — and thus about the very propriety of the settlement and plan itself."" the trustee's objection also raised concerns about the release from liability of multiple parties whose exact relationship to the entities involved in the two-step was not laid out in the disclosure statement. the proposed global settlement would protect tehum, yescare, and many of their current or former executives and directors from any future lawsuits related to corizon's care. if creditors approve it, more than 350 lawsuits alleging medical negligence over corizon's care at jails and prisons nationwide would be abruptly resolved. so would dozens of employment-lawsuits over allegations including discrimination, wage theft, and wrongful termination, along with claims regarding millions of dollars in unpaid invoices from hospitals and other health care providers. lopez said if his outstanding questions remain unanswered in the disclosure documents, he won't approve the disclosure package, or potentially even the underlying plan. ""there's not enough information here for me to feel comfortable that this disclosure statement — and maybe those parties don't want any more information disclosed — but that may mean other hard decisions get made,"" lopez said. ""sometimes the outcome is harsh, but that's where we are."" the son of hector garcia, who died in august 2019 at the age of 55 after receiving shoddy medical care from corizon at a jail in new mexico, according to his family's suit, told insider that he's thrilled by the judge's decision not to immediately approve the disclosure documents. hector garcia jr., who dialed in to the hearing, said he was blown away by the judge's words. ""it's like a complete 360 turnaround,"" he said. ""i'm so happy that our voice is being heard now.""",Neutral,"A $37 million settlement in the bankruptcy of prison health care company Tehum is in jeopardy. A federal judge declined to approve the plan's disclosures, citing unanswered questions about the parties involved and the fairness of the deal to creditors, including incarcerated plaintiffs.

Despite aid efforts, many residents have yet to receive assistance. Protesters have blocked roads, demanding aid for outlying hamlets that have been forgotten. The government has promised help, including an ""air bridge"" for aid distribution and a house-by-house census to assess needs."

<ul><li>Kamala Harris' tenure as vice president has been marked by a series of high-profile ups and downs.</li><li>Voting rights activist LaTosh… [+3707 chars]",Mexico,"when kamala harris catapulted into national prominence as a us senator representing california, many political observers compared her to former president barack obama. both have been trailblazing black politicians, as obama occupied the oval office for eight years, while harris was tapped by joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate — with the ticket's 2020 victory making her the first female vice president in us history. but harris has endured a series of ups and downs after nearly three years in the role, initially dealing with high-profile staffturnoverand later battling a sense from many in washington that was struggling to carve out a policy lane that voters could respond to. such talk has been rejected by some of harris' most ardent supporters like latosha brown, a founder ofblack votes matter, whotold the new york times magazinethat she believed some democrats — including some in the white house — are looking to hold harris back. ""i think there have been saboteurs within the administration,"" brown told the times' astead w. herndon. ""i think that they are worried about the age contrast. and they are worried about kamala outshining biden."" over the past year, harris has been perhaps the administration's most forceful advocate for abortion rights, rallying women across the country after the supreme court voted tooverturnroe v. wade. the vice president has also beenan in-demand speakeramong college students — especially at historically black colleges and universities. biden has repeatedly praised harris' policy acumen and the strengths that he said she has brought to the administration,telling msnbcearlier this year that she ""hasn't gotten the credit that she deserves."" and when biden rolled out hisreelectionannouncement, she was front and center as he detailed why the ticket deserved to be reelected. but still, there have been questions about harris' viability as a future presidential contender and the potential face of the democratic party, especially as the party's post-biden 2028 primary is likely to attract a slew of candidates. brown — whose organization played a role in georgia voter organizing efforts ahead of sens. raphael warnock and jon ossoff victories in the state's january 2021 runoff elections — initially backed sen. elizabeth warren of massachusetts over harris in the 2020 democratic presidential primary. but brown told the magazine that she believed she had underestimated harris at the time and later decided to fight hard for her selection as biden's running mate. and brown rejected the notion that biden's vow to select a female running mate — and the push for to him to tap a black woman — created a situation where some would discount harris' abilities. harris' 2021interviewwith nbc news anchor lester holt — where she was questioned about her lack of on-the-ground time at the us-mexico border and criticized over her response — remains on the minds of some voters who may be still be unsure of the vice president's main policy focus. but the administration has been unwavering in their support of harris, with white house senior advisor anita dunn telling the magazine that the vice president had some earlier stumbles but ""has found her voice, and she's found her role."" dunn also shut down any rumors that harris might be replaced as biden's running mate next year. ""this administration has never polled it,"" dunn told the magazine. ""never thought about it. never discussed it.""",Negative,"Kamala Harris, the first female Vice President, has faced challenges in her role, including staff turnover and criticism over her policy focus. Despite these setbacks, she has emerged as a strong advocate for abortion rights and a popular speaker among college students. The Biden administration remains supportive of Harris, dismissing rumors of her replacement as running mate. However, questions linger about her viability as a future presidential contender."

""we believe the appropriate course of action is to permit a panel of new mexico citizens to determine from here whether mr baldwin should be held over for criminal trial,"" they added.  in an interview with the new york times on tuesday, ms morrissey said that ""the forensic testing of the gun concluded with certainty that the trigger of the gun had to have been pulled for the gun to go off"". she added that prosecutors intend to begin presenting their case to a grand jury on 16 november.  the film's armourer, hannah gutierrez-reed, faces two counts of involuntary manslaughter.",Neutral,"New Mexico prosecutors plan to recharge Alec Baldwin with involuntary manslaughter for the fatal on-set shooting in 2021.

mighty is now a dry riverbed, lined ominously with barbed wire.in the u.s., people often think of the rio grande mainly as a political border that features in negotiations over immigration, narcotics smuggling and trade. but there's another crisis on the river that receives far less attention. the river is in decline, suffering from overuse, drought and contentious water rights negotiations.urban and rural border communities with poor infrastructure,known in spanish as colonias, are particularly vulnerable to thewater crisis. farmers and cities insouthern texasandnorthern mexicoare also affected. as researchers who studyhydrologyandtransboundary water management, we believe managing this important resource requires closer cooperation between the u.s. and mexico.a hidden water crisisfor nearly 80 years, the u.s. and mexico have managed and distributed water from the colorado river and the lower rio grande—from fort quitman, texas, to the gulf of mexico—under the1944 water treaty, signed by presidents franklin d. roosevelt and manuel avila camacho. the colorado river was thecentral focus of treaty negotiationsbecause officials believed the colorado basin would have moreeconomic activityand population growth, so it would need more water. in fact, however, the rio grande basin has also seen significant growth.for the rio grande, the treaty allocates specific shares of water to the u.s. and mexico from both the river's main stem and its tributaries in texas and mexico. delivery of water from six mexican tributaries has become the source of contention. one-third of this flow is allocated to the u.s., and must total some 76 million cubic feet (2.2 million cubic meters) over each five-year period.the treaty allows mexico to roll any accrued deficits at the end of a five-year cycle over to the next cycle. deficits can only be rolled over once, and they must be made up along with the required deliveries for the following five-year period.the rio grande is one of the largest rivers in the southwest u.s. and northern mexico. because of drought and overuse, sections of the river frequently run dry. credit:kmusser/wikipedia,cc by-sathese five-year periods, called cycles, are numbered. cycles 25 (1992-1997) and 26 (1997-2002) were the first time that two consecutive cycles ended in deficit. like the colorado river, the rio grandehas become over-allocated: the 1944 treaty promises users more water than there is in the river. the main causes arepersistent droughtand increased water demand on both sides of the border.much of this demand was generated bythe 1992 north american free trade agreement, which eliminated most border tariffs between canada, the u.s. and mexico. from 1993 through 2007, agricultural imports and exports between the u.s. and mexico quadrupled, and there was extensive expansion ofmaquiladoras—assembly plants along the border. this growth increased water demand.ultimately, mexico delivered more than the required amount for cycle 27 (2002-2007), plus its incurred deficit from cycles 25 and 26, by transferring water from its reservoirs. this outcome appeased texas users but left mexico vulnerable. since then, mexico has continued to struggle to meet its treaty responsibilities and has experienced chronic water shortages.in 2020, a confrontation erupted in the state of chihuahua between the mexican national guard and farmers who believed delivery to texas of water from the rio conchos—one of the six tributaries regulated under the 1944 treaty—threatened their survival. in 2022, people lined up at water distribution sites inthe mexican city of monterrey, where the population had doubled since 1990. as of 2023, halfway through cycle 36, mexico has only deliveredsome 25% of its targeted amount.border politics overshadow water shortagesas climate change makes the southwest hotter and drier, scientists predict thatwater shortages on the rio grande will intensify. in this context, the 1944 treaty pits humanitarian needs for water in the u.s. against those in mexico.it also pits the needs of different sectors against one another. agriculture is thedominant water consumerin the region, followed by residential use. when there is a drought, however, the treaty prioritizes residential water use over agriculture.the rio grande is affected by nearly the same hydroclimate conditions as the colorado river, which flows mainly through the southwest u.s. but ends in mexico. however, drought and water shortages in the colorado river basin receive much more public attention than the same problems on the rio grande. u.s. media outlets cover the rio grande almost exclusively when it figures in stories about immigration and river crossings, such as texas gov. greg abbott's 2023 decision to installfloating barriersin the river at widely used crossing points.farmers as far north as colorado rely on water from the rio grande for irrigation.the compact that governs use of colorado river water has widely recognized flaws: the agreement is 100 years old, allocates more rights to water than the river holds, and completely excludes native american tribes. however, negotiations over the colorado between compact states and the u.s. and mexico are much more focused than decision-making about rio grande water, which has to compete with many other bilateral issues.adapting to the futureas we see it, the 1944 water treaty is inadequate to solve the complex social, economic, hydrological and political challenges that exist today in the rio grande basin. we believe it needs revision to reflect modern conditions.this can be done through theminute process, which permits mexico and the u.s. to adopt legally binding amendments without having to renegotiate the entire agreement. the two countries have already used this process to update the treaty as it pertains to the colorado riverin 2012andagain in 2017.these steps allowed the u.s. to adjust its deliveries of colorado river water to mexico based on water levels in lake mead, the colorado's largest reservoir, in ways that proportionally distributed drought impacts between the two

delivery from el paso to ciudad juarez. in 2013, for example,mexico received only 6%of the water it was due under the 1906 convention.enabling mexico to proportionally reduce rio grande deliveries

that features in negotiations over immigration, narcotics smuggling and trade. but there's another crisis on the river that receives far less attention. the river is in decline, suffering from overuse, drought and contentious water rights negotiations.urban and rural border communities with poor infrastructure,known in spanish as colonias, are particularly vulnerable to thewater crisis. farmers and cities insouthern texasandnorthern mexicoare also affected. as researchers who studyhydrologyandtransboundary water management, we believe managing this important resource requires closer cooperation between the u.s. and mexico.a hidden water crisisfor nearly 80 years, the u.s. and mexico have managed and distributed water from the colorado river and the lower rio grande—from fort quitman, texas, to the gulf of mexico—under the1944 water treaty, signed by presidents franklin d. roosevelt and manuel avila camacho. the colorado river was thecentral focus of treaty negotiationsbecause officials believed the colorado basin would have moreeconomic activityand population growth, so it would need more water. in fact, however, the rio grande basin has also seen significant growth.for the rio grande, the treaty allocates specific shares of water to the u.s. and mexico from both the river's main stem and its tributaries in texas and mexico. delivery of water from six mexican tributaries has become the source of contention. one-third of this flow is allocated to the u.s., and must total some 76 million cubic feet (2.2 million cubic meters) over each five-year period.the treaty allows mexico to roll any accrued deficits at the end of a five-year cycle over to the next cycle. deficits can only be rolled over once, and they must be made up along with the required deliveries for the following five-year period.the rio grande is one of the largest rivers in the southwest u.s. and northern mexico. because of drought and overuse, sections of the river frequently run dry. credit:kmusser/wikipedia,cc by-sathese five-year periods, called cycles, are numbered. cycles 25 (1992-1997) and 26 (1997-2002) were the first time that two consecutive cycles ended in deficit. like the colorado river, the rio grandehas become over-allocated: the 1944 treaty promises users more water than there is in the river. the main causes arepersistent droughtand increased water demand on both sides of the border.much of this demand was generated bythe 1992 north american free trade agreement, which eliminated most border tariffs between canada, the u.s. and mexico. from 1993 through 2007, agricultural imports and exports between the u.s. and mexico quadrupled, and there was extensive expansion ofmaquiladoras—assembly plants along the border. this growth increased water demand.ultimately, mexico delivered more than the required amount for cycle 27 (2002-2007), plus its incurred deficit from cycles 25 and 26, by transferring water from its reservoirs. this outcome appeased texas users but left mexico vulnerable. since then, mexico has continued to struggle to meet its treaty responsibilities and has experienced chronic water shortages.in 2020, a confrontation erupted in the state of chihuahua between the mexican national guard and farmers who believed delivery to texas of water from the rio conchos—one of the six tributaries regulated under the 1944 treaty—threatened their survival. in 2022, people lined up at water distribution sites inthe mexican city of monterrey, where the population had doubled since 1990. as of 2023, halfway through cycle 36, mexico has only deliveredsome 25% of its targeted amount.border politics overshadow water shortagesas climate change makes the southwest hotter and drier, scientists predict thatwater shortages on the rio grande will intensify. in this context, the 1944 treaty pits humanitarian needs for water in the u.s. against those in mexico.it also pits the needs of different sectors against one another. agriculture is thedominant water consumerin the region, followed by residential use. when there is a drought, however, the treaty prioritizes residential water use over agriculture.the rio grande is affected by nearly the same hydroclimate conditions as the colorado river, which flows mainly through the southwest u.s. but ends in mexico. however, drought and water shortages in the colorado river basin receive much more public attention than the same problems on the rio grande. u.s. media outlets cover the rio grande almost exclusively when it figures in stories about immigration and river crossings, such as texas gov. greg abbott's 2023 decision to installfloating barriersin the river at widely used crossing points.farmers as far north as colorado rely on water from the rio grande for irrigation.the compact that governs use of colorado river water has widely recognized flaws: the agreement is 100 years old, allocates more rights to water than the river holds, and completely excludes native american tribes. however, negotiations over the colorado between compact states and the u.s. and mexico are much more focused than decision-making about rio grande water, which has to compete with many other bilateral issues.adapting to the futureas we see it, the 1944 water treaty is inadequate to solve the complex social, economic, hydrological and political challenges that exist today in the rio grande basin. we believe it needs revision to reflect modern conditions.this can be done through theminute process, which permits mexico and the u.s. to adopt legally binding amendments without having to renegotiate the entire agreement. the two countries have already used this process to update the treaty as it pertains to the colorado riverin 2012andagain in 2017.these steps allowed the u.s. to adjust its deliveries of colorado river water to mexico based on water levels in lake mead, the colorado's largest

The 1944 water treaty between the U.S. and Mexico allocates water from the river and its tributaries, but it is inadequate to address modern challenges. The treaty prioritizes residential water use over agriculture during droughts, and the Rio Grande receives less public attention than the Colorado River despite facing similar water shortages. The compact governing Colorado River water has recognized flaws, but negotiations over it are more focused than those over Rio Grande water, which competes with other bilateral issues. To address the crisis, the 1944 treaty needs to be revised to reflect modern conditions through the ""minute process,"" which allows for legally binding amendments without renegotiating the entire agreement. Enabling Mexico to proportionally reduce Rio Grande deliveries according to drought conditions would distribute drought and climate change impacts more fairly between the two countries. This cooperation could deliver human, ecological, and political benefits in a complex and contentious region."

<… [+8694 chars]",Mexico,"a powerful group of senators have pressed for answers about the bankruptcy of the private prison healthcare provider formerly known as corizon health. in aletter sent tuesdayto executives of corizon's successor companies — yescare and tehum care services — the lawmakers say corizon employed an ""abusive"" bankruptcy strategy to avoid paying not just medical-malpractice lawsuits but also ""bills for tens of millions of dollars' worth of goods and services provided to corizon by hospitals, small businesses, and your own former employees."" the nine senators include elizabeth warren, bernie sanders, cory booker, judiciary committee chair dick durbin, and finance committee chair ron wyden. they raise questions in the seven-page letter about the company's ""largely anonymous investors,"" the company's ""obfuscation of its ownership structure,"" the assets it has transferred to ""affiliated entities,"" and its attempts to escape liability for hundreds of medical-malpractice lawsuits filed by current and former prisoners. ""the bankruptcy system has many aims, but it was not designed to provide an avenue for companies to evade accountability for wrongdoing,"" the lawmakers write. tehum filed for bankruptcy in february — the final step in a controversial legal maneuver in which corizon moved to texas and split in two. as a result of the tactic, dubbed the texas two-step, one company, called yescare, got all of corizon's corrections contracts while the other, tehum, was saddled with corizon's civil suits and most of its debt. insider first reported on the company'suse of the two-stepin august. in the letter, addressed to yescare ceo jeffrey sholey and isaac lefkowitz, tehum's sole director, the senators blasted corizon's attempt ""to manipulate bankruptcy law with the aim of skirting accountability for the harms that incarcerated individuals have endured under corizon's care."" ""the texas two-step is a distorted use of the u.s. bankruptcy system by corporations to evade mass tort liability,"" the senators write. ""your company has taken this abusive strategy a step farther."" the lawmakers urge sholey and lefkowitz to use ""the full financial capabilities"" of yescare, tehum, and other related entities to ""provide full relief for meritorious claims against corizon by all incarcerated people, their families, former employees, and third-party medical providers."" those claims total more than$1.2 billion, and tehum is seeking to settle them for $37 million. the senators have given tehum and yescare two weeks to answer nine detailed questions about their leadership, ownership structure, corporate assets, affiliated entities, the civil suits against them, and the bankruptcy settlement negotiations themselves. ""for too long, corporations like corizon have taken advantage of our bankruptcy system, engaging in maneuvers like the texas two-step to hide from victims who deserve to be treated fairly,"" sen. warren told insider. ""i'm calling for answers from corizon."" sholey, lefkowitz, yescare, and tehum did not immediately respond to requests for comment. corizon was once one of the nation's largest private prison healthcare providers, but claims of malpractice and patient neglect had been mounting against it for years. the senators excoriate corizon for its repeated failure to provide adequate healthcare to prisoners, itemizing what they describe as ""glaring instances of neglect."" the letter specifically mentions the case of hector garcia, a father of four who died three days into a six-day sentence at a new mexico jail, a caseinsider profiled. the letter says ""corizon providers ignored complaints of intense pain caused by an entirely treatable existing condition providers should have been aware of."" as his son hector garcia jr.told insider, ""it's not like he had a chance to call an ambulance himself."" the lawmakers' letter criticizes corizon's use of the texas two-step ""to pay pennies on the dollar to claimants that deserve recompense for poor health outcomes."" and it says serious questions remain about the opaque ownership behind yescare and tehum, issues first raised ininsider's reporting. ""reporting suggests that the largely unknown investors and associates that spearheaded the texas two-step have engaged in questionable and unjust tactics,"" the letter says. ""this misuse of the bankruptcy system is unacceptable, and we are concerned that it may result in the denial of hundreds of claims stemming from the substandard care incarcerated people have received under corizon's watch."" warren had already expressed concern about one company affiliate. in january 2021, shesent a letterto the national nursing home chain genesis healthcare, questioning why the company had paid top executives millions of dollars in bonuses even though it had received $300 million in government aid and more than 2,800 residents died on its watch during the pandemic. according toan alabama bid documentobtained by insider, yescare is managed and financially supported by geneva consulting llc, a wholly owned subsidiary of genesis. lefkowitz, the sole director of tehum, is now also a director at genesis. the bid says yescare entered into a management service agreement with geneva consulting — and the relationship between the two companies caught the senators' attention. they write that evidence suggests ""yescare may in fact be owned by geneva consulting or its parent, the nursing home giant genesis healthcare inc."" ""corizon's obfuscation of its ownership structure,"" they write, ""heightens our concern that the company is attempting to evade liability."" until recently, the bankruptcy looked to be on its way to a swift conclusion. tehum and its largest creditors had submitted a joint bankruptcy plan proposing the $37 million settlement, which would have given current and former incarcerated patients just $5,000 apiece for their medical-malpractice claims — even in cases where prisoners under corizon's care. then the judge who oversaw the settlement talks, david jones,suddenly resignedafter insider published allegations that he was inan undisclosed romantic relationshipwith an attorney who represented yescare in the negotiations. meanwhile, the us trustee program, in charge of watching over the integrity of the bankruptcy system,filed an objectionin bankruptcy court, citing jones' involvement in the mediation and other concerns. in the latest blow, christopher lopez, the federal bankruptcy judge overseeing the case,said at a hearing last weekthat creditors needed more time to review the settlement — rejecting attempts by tehum's attorneys to expedite approval. so far, the company has attempted to wall off yescare's assets from tehum's creditors, claiming that the two companies are separate. the senators forcefully pushed back on that in the letter, writing that claims of ""corporate separateness"" are ""a transparent and unconvincing attempt to avoid adequately compensating victims."" warren and durbin have taken a hard line on the texas two-step, which was attempted most famously by johnson & johnson to try to shed tens of thousands of talc-powder lawsuits. five of the signers of tuesday's letter are members of the senate judiciary committee, which held a hearing last month on the two-step with the sharply worded title ""evading accountability: corporate manipulation of chapter 11 bankruptcy."" in july 2021, warren introduceda billthat would have amended us bankruptcy code to allow judges to dismiss a case if the bankrupt company had used a divisional merger over the prior 10 years in order to separate its assets from its liabilities. the divisional merger, legal only in texas and a few other states, is the maneuver underlying the two-step. durbin, sanders, booker, warren, and wyden were joined in tuesday's letter by democratic sens. richard blumenthal of connecticut, mazie hirono of hawaii, jeff merkley of oregon, and peter welch of vermont. yescare and tehum have until november 8 to respond.",Negative,"Nine senators have demanded answers from Corizon Health's successor companies, YesCare and Tehum, regarding their ""abusive"" bankruptcy strategy to avoid paying medical malpractice lawsuits and debts. The senators question the companies' ownership structure, asset transfers, and attempts to escape liability for hundreds of lawsuits. They urge YesCare and Tehum to provide full relief for claims against Corizon, totaling over $1.2 billion. The senators criticize Corizon's use of the ""Texas Two-Step"" to evade accountability for substandard healthcare provided to prisoners."

Communication has been disrupted, making it difficult to assess the extent of the damage. Humanitarian aid is being sent to the affected area, but the lack of communication is hindering efforts. The storm has weakened to a tropical storm, but heavy rains continue to cause flooding and mudslides. Hurricanes are common in Mexico, but few make landfall as a Category 5 storm."
